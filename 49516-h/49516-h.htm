<h2><i>Preface.</i></h2>
</div>

<p><i>To anticipate for this little book that it may prove the
means of convincing a single Baconian of the error of his
ways, would be to express a hope that has only the faintest
chance of realisation. Baconianism is so wilful and so
obstinate that it is not amenable to any treatment that has
yet been invented. It has its root in an entire misconception
of the character and temperament of the man Bacon; it is
nourished on the grossest misrepresentation of the man
Shakespeare that the memory of an author has ever been
subjected to. So long as the fallacy, backed up by specious
argument, was confined to the consideration of the mighty
few, it was scarcely necessary to enter into the lists with
the Baconian champions, but the new and energetic move
which is now being made to cast down Shakespeare from the
“topmost pinnacle in the temple of fame,” and to set up the
figure of Bacon in his stead, has had the result of bringing
the subject once more into public view. In the circumstances,
the publication of the following summary of the
evidence may be found not inopportune. It may not effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
a cure in the case of confirmed Baconians, but I have a
modest hope that it will enable the unprejudiced inquirer to
be on his guard against the hallucination. The Baconians
have woven a cunning mesh of fact and fable to entangle the
mind of the unwary; the task I have set myself is to review
the premises, test the arguments, and combat the conclusions
upon which Bacon’s pretensions to the authorship of Shakespeare’s
plays is alleged to rest, and to explain the reasons
that we hold for ascribing the authorship of the Plays to
Shakespeare.</i></p>

<p><i>While the majority of Shakespearean students are impatient
of discussion, the disciples of the Baconian theory are prompt
and eager and voluminous in the propagation of their
arguments. Indeed, they have, all along, had the lion’s
share in the controversy, and by their much speaking, have
stormed the ears of that section of the public which neither
thinks for itself, nor will be at the trouble to verify what it
is told. Bacon has been born again in the biographies of
his devotees, and Shakespeare, by the same agency, has been
edited out of recognition. Bacon’s brilliant intellectual
qualities have been taken as the basis of all argument, the
human and temperamental side of his character has been
boldly made amenable to the exigencies of argument, and his
many glaringly reprehensible actions have been carefully
ignored. I have endeavoured, in the ensuing pages, not so
much to give a picture of the complete man, as to show what
he was capable of in the way of selfishness, trickery and
subterfuge. He was capable of the basest ingratitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
meanness, of the employment of barbarity when it suited his
purpose, of unctuous servility and boundless egoism. He had
neither the temperament nor the poetical ability nor the
time to write the Plays; had he the meanness of spirit to
claim them as his own? We shall see!</i></p>

<p><i>The conclusions I have formed with respect to the two
cipher revelations which are now agitating the minds of both
Shakespeareans and Baconians are derived partly from my
estimate of the character of Bacon, partly from the apparent
sincerity of Mrs. Gallup, and partly again from what I
know of other and entirely independent decipherations of
further Bacon messages, which are now being actively made
in this country. Of Mrs. Gallup I only know that which
her book and her publishers reveal. Of Dr. Orville W.
Owen, the discoverer of the word-cipher I learn, from an
American source, quoted by way of a testimonial in one of
the doctor’s books, that he is “a man who has reached
middle age,” and who has “never shown the slightest sign
of possessing unusual or extraordinary literary skill, or
genius.” In other words, his sponsors assure us that he is
incapable of writing those portions of Shakespeare which
form so great a part of his decipherations, or even the
connecting passages which appear to have been contributed
by Bacon. We must accept this opinion as a tribute of
personal character.</i></p>

<p><i>Concerning the illustrations, I may be allowed to say a
few explanatory words. The two photogravure reproductions
are taken respectively from a miniature by Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
Oliver, belonging to the Duke of Buccleuch, and from a
very rare print of Bacon. The print from Vansomer’s
painting, the picture of Bacon’s monument, and the portraits
of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Sir Nathaniel Bacon, the Earl of
Essex and Queen Elizabeth, and the views of Stratford-on-Avon
and Gorhambury will, I trust, be found of general
interest. The facsimile pages from “Sylva Sylvarum” and
the “Novum Organum,” with their allegorical devises and
fine workmanship, illustrate the contrast between the manner
in which the works of Bacon and those of Shakespeare were
given to the world. The portraits of Shakespeare contained
here are well known to students. The reproduction of the
bust will be familiar to all visitors to Stratford, the
“Droeshout” Engraving is the picture which forms the
frontispiece to the First Folio, and the original of the
Chandos portrait is now in the National Portrait Gallery.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is impossible to sympathise with, or even to regard
seriously, the spirit in which a small, but growing section
of the reading public of America, and of this country, has
plunged into the controversy respecting the authorship of
the so-called Shakespeare plays. The fantastic doubt
which compelled individual scholars to investigate a theory
of their own inventing, to lay, so to speak, the ghost they
had themselves raised, has inspired distrust in the minds
that had no beliefs, and generated scepticism in those
where no faith was. The search for the truth has degenerated
into a wild-goose chase; the seekers after some new
thing have made the quest their own; ignorance has
plagiarised from prejudice; the “grand old Bacon-Shakespeare
controversy,” as Whistler said of Art, is
upon the town&mdash;“to be chucked under the chin by the
passing gallant&mdash;to be enticed within the gates of the
householder&mdash;to be coaxed into company as a proof of
culture and refinement.” The difficulties that such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
controversy present to the tea-table oracles are both
numerous, and exceeding obstinate. The people who
read Shakespeare form a pitiably insignificant proportion
of the community, but they are multitudinous compared
with those who have the remotest acquaintance with the
works of Francis Bacon. Bacon is known to some as
Elizabeth’s little Lord Keeper, to others his name recalls
the fact that he was James the First’s Lord Chancellor,
but outside his <i>Essays</i>, and, perhaps, <i>The New Atlantis</i>, his
great philosophical dissertations, the pride and treasure
which he so carefully preserved in Latin, lest they should
be lost in the decay of modern languages, are a sealed
book to all, except a few odd scholars at the Universities.
Bacon is an extinct volcano. The fact is not creditable
to the culture of the age, but it is incontrovertible.</p>

<p>It has, on this account, been found necessary for
Baconians to describe to their readers what manner of man
this was whom they would perch on Shakespeare’s pedestal,
and they have accomplished their task in the manner best
calculated to lend plausibility to their theories. Moreover,
they have displayed a subtle appreciation of the magnitude
of their undertaking. The Shakespeare plays, in common
with all great works, reflect in some degree the personality
of their creator. The Baconian students cannot deny that
there are many characteristics in their candidate which
only the most devout can reconcile with the spirit of the
plays. It, therefore, became further necessary to ring the
changes on their candidate; to employ the arguments of
induction and deduction as best suited the exigencies of
the task. In creating the idol of Bacon, much had to be
read into the subject, and it would seem that the simplest
method by which they could advance the claims of Bacon
was by discrediting the claims of Shakespeare. In
estimating the character of Viscount St. Alban, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
the solid foundation of fact for our guidance; the personal
details of Shakespeare’s career may be written upon a page
of note paper. The original Baconians seized upon these
few details to distort them to their own ends, and their
followers have done their best to perpetuate the outrage.</p>

<p>In the scope of this volume it is not possible, nor is it
necessary, to attempt an intimate analysis of the characters
of Bacon and Shakespeare, but a resumé of the leading
incidents in their lives, a brief review for the purpose of
making a comparison of their respective temperaments,
will not be out of place. In the following pages my endeavour
has been to arrange, as systematically as possible,
the reasons for my belief&mdash;for these I invite a courteous
hearing; as for the conclusions I have formed, I am
content to abide by them.</p>

<p>My last desire in dealing with the career of Lord
Bacon has been to find reasons for supposing him to be
the author of Shakespeare’s plays. That endeavour has
been made by his many champions with more sanguinity
than I could display, and I have carefully weighed every
argument and fact advanced in his favour. I have read,
and re-read, and argued against myself, the claims which
have been put forward with so much earnestness and evident
conviction. But against these I have had to set the bald
facts that make the claim untenable. The biographers of
Bacon have been burdened with the ungrateful necessity of
finding excuses, and of making endless apologies for their
hero. Bacon’s greatest editor, the scholar who devoted
some 30 years to the work&mdash;who brought more knowledge,
and disclosed more analytical acumen and skilled judgment
in his task than any editor ever brought to bear upon the
life and works of a single author&mdash;has stated his reasons
for his disbelief in the Baconian theory. When it is
remembered that Spedding’s knowledge of Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
was “extensive and profound, and his laborious and subtle
criticism derived additional value from his love of the
stage,” his decision on the subject must be accepted, if
not as incontrovertible, at least, as the most damaging
blow to the Baconian theory we shall ever get.</p>

<p>A well-known writer, in declaring that a man’s morality
has nothing to do with his prose, perpetrated an aphorism
which Baconians have adduced to reconcile the psychological
differences which we find between Bacon, the man,
and Bacon, the author of the plays traditionally attributed
to Shakespeare. The least erudite student of Shakespeare
has felt the magic of the dramatist’s boundless sympathy,
his glowing imagination, his gentleness, truth and simplicity.
His mind, as Hazlitt recognised, contained within
itself the germs of all faculty and feeling, and Mr. Sidney
Lee, in his general estimate of Shakespeare’s genius, has
written, “In knowledge of human nature, in wealth of
humour, in depth of passion, in fertility of fancy, and in
soundness of judgment, he has not a rival.” Henry
Chettle refers to “his uprightness of dealing which argues
his honesty,” the author of <i>The Return from Parnassus</i>
apostrophised him as “sweet Master Shakespeare,” and
Ben Jonson, his friend and fellow labourer, wrote of him,
“I loved the man, and do honour his memory, on this
side idolatry as much as any. He was indeed honest, and
of an open and free nature.”</p>

<p>An author’s morality, or rather his lack of it, may not
detract from the grace and clarity of his style, but
it must inevitably leave its mark in his matter. There is
poetry that reveals only the brilliance of the writer’s brain&mdash;if
such can be termed poetry; there is prose which lays
bare the writer’s heart. In Shakespeare we have verse
which evidences the possession of both the mental and the
temperamental qualities in the highest perfection. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Shakespeare the genius, the artist, the creator, the master
manipulator of theatrical machinery. There is Shakespeare
the man&mdash;the citizen of whom Jonson wrote in terms of
the warmest affection. In what degree do we find these
qualities which are inseparably associated with Shakespeare
in the character of Francis Bacon?</p>

<p>For every act of Bacon’s life we are met with apologies,
explanations, and extravagant defences. Lord Macaulay’s
bitter and brilliant analysis of the Lord Chancellor (a
retaliatory treatise prompted by the ingenuity and perversions
of his enamoured champions), has been robbed of
its sting by the less brilliant, but more knowledgable
and judicious Spedding, who in his <i>Evenings with a
Reviewer</i>, clearly and dispassionately reduces Macaulay’s
estimate to its correct biographical and critical level. But
there are acts in the life of Bacon that, shorn of all the
swaddling clothes of specious explanation, reveal the man
in a light which, in spite of valiant speculation and
portentous argument, in spite even of Bacon’s sworn
word, render his claims to the mantle of Shakespeare an
absurdity&mdash;and an impertinence.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon, the youngest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon,
Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, by his second wife (Ann,
daughter of Sir Anthony Coke), was born on 22nd
January, 1561. He was the product of the age in which
he lived. A politician by heredity, a student by nature, a
courtier and place-seeker by force of circumstances, he
fulfilled his inevitable destiny. In a court in which the
politics were based on the teachings of Machiavelli, in
which intrigue was a sport and a fine art, where flattery
and lying were necessities, and personal advancement the
one incentive to every act, Bacon intrigued, supplicated,
flattered, cringed, and lied himself into prominence. Nor
must the future Lord Chancellor be judged too harshly on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
that account. He was only gambling with the current
coin of his environment. By nature, he was averse to
Jesuitry, but he was forced by circumstances and his
ambitions to employ it. “What the art of oratory was in
democratic Athens,” Dr. Edwin A. Abbott writes, “that
the art of lying and flattery was for a courtier in the latter
part of the Elizabethan monarchy.” In this atmosphere
of falseness and deception Bacon, with good credentials,
a fine intellect, little money, many influential acquaintances,
but few true friends, had to battle for his own fortunes.
It is evident that he early recognised the exigencies of the
warfare. He absorbed and assimilated the poison of his
surroundings; he was both malleable and inventive. His
frame of mind is best illustrated by two of his maxims.
Truth, he declares is noble, and falsehood is base; yet
“mixture of falsehood is like alloy in the coin of gold and
silver, which may make the metal work the better.” Again,
“The best composition and temperament is to have openness
in fame and opinion, secrecy in habit, dissimulation in
seasonable use, and a power to feign if there be no remedy.”</p>

<p>In the Elizabethan Court, the man who desired
preferment had to plead for it. At the age of 16, Francis
Bacon, after leaving Cambridge, had been admitted as
“an ancient” of Gray’s Inn, and in the following year
was sent to Paris in the suite of Sir Amias Paulet, the
English Ambassador. Two years later, on the death of
his father, he returned to England, to find himself destitute
of the patrimony he had expected to inherit, and forced
to select the alternative of immediate work or the accumulation
of debts. In this emergency he applied to his uncle,
Lord Burghley, for advancement, and attempted to win
the favour of the Queen by addressing to her a treatise
entitled, <i>Advice to Queen Elizabeth</i>. This letter is
remarkable for its lofty tone, its statesmanship, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
boldness, but it is marred by the appendix, in which the
author states that he is bold to entertain his opinions,
“till I think that you think otherwise.” This fatal pliancy,
this note of excessive obsequiousness, lasted him through
life.</p>

<p>The want of success, which attended his first efforts to
gain official recognition, caused Bacon to decide, once and
for all, upon his choice of a career. His path lay either in
the way of politics, which meant preferment, power, and
wealth; or science, philosophy, and the development of
the arts and inventions that tend to civilise the life of
man. No work seemed to him so meritorious as the
latter, and for this he considered himself best adapted.
“Whereas, I believe myself born for the service of
mankind,” he declared, in 1603, in the preface to <i>The
Interpretation of Nature</i>; and in a letter to Lord Treasurer
Burghley, “I have taken all knowledge to be my province.”
Again, “I found in my own nature a special adaptation
for the contemplation of truth.... Imposture in every
shape I utterly detested.” But, as he proceeds to explain,
“my birth, my rearing, and education,” pointed not
towards philosophy, but towards “politics;” love of
truth and detestation of imposture was in his heart, but
“the power to feign if there be no remedy” was there
engraved also; the practical value of the “mixture of
falsehood” was in his blood. And the want of money
influenced him in forming his decision. In 1621, when
his public career came to its disgraceful close, he declared
that his greatest sin had been his desertion of philosophy
and his having allowed himself to be diverted into politics.
“Besides my innumerable sins,” he cries out in his
confession to the “Searcher of Souls,” “I confess before
Thee that I am debtor to Thee for the gracious talent of
Thy gifts and graces, which I have neither put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
napkin, nor put it as I ought to exchangers, where it might
have made most profit; but misspent it in things for which
I was least fit, so that I may truly say, my soul has been a
stranger in the course of my pilgrimage.” At the beginning
of his history, Bacon pleads his birth, his rearing and
education as excuses for his choice of a career, and at its
close, in <i>De Augmentis</i>, he throws the blame on “destiny”
for carrying him into a political vortex. Dr. Abbott sums
up his life-story in a phrase&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">multum incola</i>; with it his
public career began and ended.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_2"><i>Bacon, the Friend of Essex and Cecil.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Having</span> failed to secure the goodwill of Burghley,
Bacon addressed himself to the Earl of Essex, and
when, in 1593, Francis came under the Queen’s displeasure,
Essex pleaded for his re-instatement in the Royal favour.
Bacon himself practised every abasement, and, ever
failing, debased himself to what he himself described as
an exquisite disgrace. From this time until the day
when there were “none so poor to do him reverence,” the
Earl of Essex was Bacon’s warm friend, patron, and
benefactor. He tided him over his monetary difficulties,
made him his counsellor, and among other gifts presented
him with a piece of land worth between £7,000 and £8,000.
Bacon repaid his friendship with advice, which, it may be
presumed, was well meant. But Bacon, the alleged author
of the plays which portray an unrivalled knowledge of
human nature, betrayed a singular and unaccountable lack
of intuition into character. His counsel was, in a large
measure, sound and sagacious, but it was utterly spoiled
by the trickiness which breathes through every precept.
If Bacon had possessed the knowledge of men that we
find in Shakespeare, he would have known that his
maxims were peculiarly unfit for Essex, who was the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
man in the world to carry into effect such a scheme of
systematic dissimulation. Dr. Abbott considers that few
things did the Earl more harm than that the friend in
whom he placed most trust gave him advice that was
rather cunning than wise. Indeed, Essex was following
the counsel of Bacon when he offered himself, in 1599,
for the command in Ireland. From this command he
returned to England a disgraced man, and his downfall
culminated in his death two years later. And in the hour
of his humiliation and dire need, when the Royal disfavour
kept all his friends from him, Bacon’s elder brother, Sir
Anthony Bacon, and the author of the Sidney papers
regarded Bacon as one of the active enemies of his former
patron.</p>

<p>Bacon’s biographers have strained every effort in
explaining and excusing his action in the ensuing trials.
Not only have they failed to exculpate him, but themselves
must realise the futility of their most ingenious endeavours
to clear his character of this foul blot. Abbott, his impartial
biographer, says: “We may acquit him of everything
but a cold-blooded indifference to his friend’s interest and
a supreme desire to pose (even at a friend’s cost) as a
loyal and much-persecuted servant of the Queen.” But,
truly, the most that can be said in extenuation of his
behaviour, is little indeed, when the friend is a man to
whom he had written, “I do think myself more beholding
to you than to any man.”</p>

<p>What, however, are the facts? When the first proceedings
were taken against Essex in the Star Chamber,
Bacon absented himself from the Court, his excuse to the
Queen being, he said, “Some indisposition of body.” His
actual letter to Elizabeth explains that his absence was
compelled by threats of violence on the part of the Earl’s
followers, whom he openly charges with a purpose to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the Queen’s life. “My life has been threatened, and my
name libelled. But these are the practices of those ...
that would put out all your Majesty’s lights, and fall on
reckoning how many years you have reigned.” Abbott
considers that we need not accuse Bacon of deliberately
intending by these words to poison the Queen’s mind
against his former friend, while Professor Gardiner
adduces this imputation as a proof that Bacon was liable to
“occasional ill-temper.” Contemporary judgment did not
so interpret the wording of the excuse. The treacherous
nature of the insinuation provoked a feeling of amazement
and anger. That his brother Anthony believed Bacon to
be capable of so great vileness is evident, and even Lord
Cecil, the Earl’s greatest enemy, wrote to Francis begging
him to be, as he himself was, “merely passive, and not
active,” in insuring the fallen Favourite’s utter ruin.</p>

<p>In the face of these warnings and remonstrances, Bacon
wrote to the Queen expressing his desire to serve her in the
second stage of the proceedings against Essex. He asked
that an important rôle might be assigned to him, but
although he was only entrusted with a subsidiary part, he
performed his task so adroitly as to earn the deep resentment
of the friends of Essex. Within a fortnight of the
Earl’s liberation Bacon again offered his services to Essex,
who accepted them!</p>

<p>What followed? Bacon devised a plan to secure the
Earl’s re-instatement in the Royal favour. The artifice
employed was to bring before the notice of Elizabeth, a
correspondence&mdash;ostensibly between Essex and his brother
Anthony&mdash;exhibiting the loyalty and love of the former
for the Queen. The letters were composed by Bacon, and
while they are interesting as specimens of the author’s
literary power, and are illustrative of his “chameleonlike
instinct of adapting his style to his atmosphere,” they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
were calculated, by the interpolation of artful passages, to
advance the interests of Bacon, rather than those of Essex,
with the Queen. It is significant also that the demeanour
which Bacon in these letters caused the Earl to assume,
he used against him when Essex was subsequently arraigned
for treason. Unless we are prepared to accept the statements
of Bacon in this connection, it is impossible to view
his participation in this second trial without a feeling of
the deepest abhorrence. Bacon had no right to be in Court
at all. As one of the “learned counsel,” his presence was
not required, but in the capacity of “friend of the accused,”
his evidence could not fail to be greatly damaging to the
Earl’s case. He proffered his evidence, not only with
readiness, but with a ferocious efficacy. We have no
evidence beyond Bacon’s own word&mdash;the word of a man
who was striving to put the best complexion on a foul act
of treachery&mdash;that he deprecated the task. “Skilfully
confusing together” the original proposal, and the abortive
execution of Essex’s outbreak, he insisted that the rising,
which in truth was a sudden after-thought, was the result
of three months’ deliberation, and he concentrated all his
efforts on proving that Essex was “not only a traitor,
but a hypocritical traitor.” No other piece of evidence
adduced at the trial had greater weight in procuring
the verdict against the Earl. Bacon subsequently pleaded
in extenuation of his behaviour that he was acting under
pressure from the Crown, but we have the knowledge
that on the first occasion he had offered his services, and
we can only conclude that at the price of sacrificing
the friend who had loaded him with kindnesses, he had
determined to make this trial a stepping-stone to Royal
favour. To serve this end, friendship, honour, obligation
were brushed aside; for, as Bacon has said in one of his
essays, the man who wishes to succeed “must know all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
conditions of the serpent.” The price Bacon received for
the blood of Essex was £1,200, or £6,000 in our currency.
“The Queen,” he wrote to a friendly creditor, “hath done
somewhat for me, though not in the perfection I hoped.”
Bacon had, it is fair to infer from this remark, betrayed
his friend; had, in fact, delivered him to the headsman for
the hope of pecuniary reward.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>Fr. verulam Cano</p></div>
  <div class="captionl serif"><i>Vansomer.</i></div></div>

<p>In what degree Bacon was responsible for the drawing
up of a <i>Declaration of the Treasons of Essex</i>, which Lord
Clarendon described as a “pestilent libel,” is impossible
to decide. He tells us that his task was little more than
that of an amanuensis to the Council and the Queen, but
this excuse fails him in the case of his <i>Apology</i>, put forth
as a vindication of the author in the estimation of the
nobles, from the charge of having been false to the Earl
of Essex. The paper is admittedly full of inaccuracies,
conveying to us the picture, “not of his actual conduct,
but of what he felt his conduct ought to have been.” Dr.
Abbott dismisses this literary and historical effort as interesting
only as a “psychological history of the manifold
and labyrinthine self-deception to which great men have
been subjected.”</p>

<p>On the accession of James I., Bacon again threw
himself into the political arena, determined to neglect no
chance of ingratiating himself with the new Sovereign.
He poured forth letters to any and everybody who had the
power to forward his cause. He dwelt in these epistles
upon the services of his brother Anthony, who had carried
on secret and intimate negotiations with Scotland. Sir
Thomas Challoner, the confirmed friend of Essex, received
a letter from him; he appealed to the Earl of Northumberland;
and became the “humble and much devoted”
servant of Lord Southampton, on the eve of that nobleman’s
release from the Tower (where Bacon had helped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
place him as an accomplice of Essex). To each he turned
with the same request that they would bury the axe, and
“further his Majesty’s good conceit and inclination
towards me.”</p>

<p>At this time, Bacon, desperately apprehensive of rebuff,
was anxious to conciliate all parties, and to secure friends
at Court. He was willing, nay, eager, to be Greek, Roman,
or Hebrew, in order to attain his object&mdash;even he would
avow a gift of poesy to make his calling and election sure.
Writing to Sir John Davies, the poet, Bacon, the politician
and philosopher, who did not publish two lines of rhyme
until twenty-one years later, desired him to “be good to
concealed poets.” Reading this statement in connection
with the other epistles he indicted at the same crisis, we
realise how little dependence can be placed upon the
implied confession that he had written anonymous poetry.
His letters to Southampton, to Michael Hickes (Cecil’s
confidential man), to David Foules and Sir Thomas
Challoner, and to the King himself, all betray the same
feverish desire to be all things to all men. He assured
Hickes that Lord Cecil is “the person in the State”
whom he “loves most,” and at the same moment he
placed his whole services at the disposal of Cecil’s rival,
the Earl of Northumberland! When the star of Northumberland
began to pale, Bacon importuned Cecil to
procure him a knighthood to gratify the ambition of an
“Alderman’s daughter, a handsome maiden,” whom he
had found “to my liking.” But for a while Bacon found
the struggle for recognition unavailing. The King found
him an acquired taste&mdash;or rather a taste that his Majesty
had yet to acquire&mdash;and after grovelling to all and sundry,
he desisted at the moment from the attempt to gain the
King’s grace, “because he had completely failed, and for
no other reason.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
But although Bacon went into retirement, he divided
his leisure between his literary labours and his quest for
political advancement. In all his political pamphlets, his
one ambition was to divine and reflect the Royal views.
In 1590 he had nothing but condemnation for the Nonconformist
party; in 1604 he had strenuously pleaded the cause
of Nonconformity; in 1616 he as strenuously opposed the
slightest concession being made to the Nonconformers. In
1604 he was returned to Parliament; three years later, his
zeal in anticipating the King’s wishes, and supporting his
proposals, was rewarded by his appointment to the
Solicitor-Generalship. In the following year he was made
clerk of the Star Chamber, and immediately set himself
to secure the displacement of Hobart, the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>Bacon’s conduct towards the Earl of Essex has already
been considered. Had this been the only instance of the
kind in his career, his apologists would have achieved
something more than public opinion can grant them in
their endeavours to explain it away. But his behaviour
towards Cecil is another lurid illustration of his duplicity
and ingratitude. During the last fourteen years of his
life Cecil had been the friend and patron of Bacon, whose
letters to him are couched in almost passionate terms of
loyalty and “entire devotion.” In one epistle he declares
himself “empty of matter,” but “out of the fulness of my
love,” he writes to express “my continual and incessant
love for you, thirsting for your return.” Cecil was his
refuge and deliverer in 1598, and again in 1603, when he
was arrested for debt, and Bacon was not empty of reason
when he asserted in another letter, “I write to myself in
regard to my love to you, you being as near to me in
heart’s blood as in blood of descent.” In 1611, a short
while before Cecil’s death, he wrote this last profession of
his <span class="locked">affection:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
“I do protest before God, without compliment, that if
I knew in what course of life to do you best service, I
would take it, and make my thoughts, which now fly to
many pieces, be reduced to that centre.”</p>

<p>In May of 1612 Cecil died. Within a week Bacon
had proffered his services to the King in the place of his
cousin, of whom he <span class="locked">wrote:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“He (Cecil) was a fit man to keep things from growing
worse, but no very fit man to reduce things to be much
better; for he loved to keep the eyes of all Israel a little
too much upon himself.”</p>

<p>To another, he wrote that Cecil “had a good method,
if his means had been upright,” and again to the King, on
the same <span class="locked">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“To have your wants, and necessities in particular, as
it were hanged up in two tablets before the eyes of your
Lords and Commons, to be talked of for four months
together; to stir a number of projects and then blast them,
and leave your Majesty nothing but the scandal of them;
to pretend even carriage between your Majesty’s rights
and the ease of the people, and to satisfy neither&mdash;these
courses, and others the like, I hope, are gone with the
deviser of them.”</p>

<p>Less than a year before, Bacon had protested before
God, “without compliment,” his desire to serve Cecil,
and now he protests to God in this letter to the King, that
when he noted “your zeal to deliver the Majesty of God
from the vain and indign comprehension of heresy and
degenerate philosophy ... <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">perculsit ilico animum</i> that God
would shortly set upon you some visible favour; and let me
not live if I thought not of the taking away of that man”&mdash;the
man as “near to me in heart’s blood as in the blood
of descent.”</p>

<p>The King, who had grown weary of Cecil, may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
accepted his death as a visible favour of God, but the
favour did not evidently embrace the substitution of Bacon
in his cousin’s stead. His application for the vacant post

</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Let</span> us regard another trait in the character of this
many-sided statesman. To relieve the King’s pressing
necessities it was proposed that voluntary contributions
should be made by the well-affected. The contributions,
commonly known as Benevolences, were rarely voluntary;
the “moral pressure” that was employed in their collection
made them in reality extortions, and, as such, they
were the cause of national dissatisfaction. During the
search of the house of a clergyman named Peacham,
consequent on some ecclesiastical charge, a sermon was
found predicting an uprising of the people against this
oppressive tax, and foretelling that the King might die
like Ananias or Nabal. The sermon had neither been
issued nor uttered, but the unfortunate rector, a very old
man, was indicted for conspiracy and, in contravention
of the law, put to the torture. Peacham had not been
convicted of treason, though Bacon “hopes that the end
will be good;” or, in other words, that he will be able to
wring from the condemned man a confession to make
good the charge.</p>

<p>The wretched old clergyman, after being examined in
Bacon’s presence, “before torture, in torture, between
torture, and after torture,” could not be made to convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
himself, and Bacon’s comment to the King is that the
man’s “raging devil seemeth to be turned into a dumb
devil.” It will be noted that this infamous act of illegality
and Bacon’s commentary are the deed and words of the
man who is supposed by some to have declared,</p>

</div>

<p>We have seen Bacon as the ingrate, and Bacon as the
brute; let us observe him “the meanest of mankind,” as
Pope described him&mdash;who, as Abbott admits, although he
refuses Pope’s description, “on sufficient occasion could
creep like a very serpent.” The sufficient occasion was the
sudden advance into fame of George Villiers, afterwards
Duke of Buckingham. The disgrace and imprisonment of
Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, whose conviction Bacon
laboured so strenuously to accomplish, doubtless inspired
the Attorney-General with the hope of becoming the chief
adviser of the Sovereign. Great must have been his mortification
when he discovered the impregnability of Villiers
in the favour of the King. But although cast down,
Bacon was not abashed. He had, on a previous occasion
of disappointment, declared that “service must creep
where it cannot go” (<i>i.e.</i>, walk upright), and he at once
determined to creep into the King’s confidence through the
medium of the rising Favourite. Instantly, Bacon was on
his knees to the new star. “I am yours,” he wrote, with
more servile want of restraint than he had disclosed in his
letters to Essex or Cecil, “surer to you than to my own
life.” In speech and behaviour he lived up to his protest.
He beslavered Villiers with flattery to his face, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
carolled his praises to those whom he felt assured would
repeat his words to the spoiled Favourite. His reward was
not long in the coming. In 1617 he was made Lord
Keeper. He took his seat in Chancery with the most
extravagant pomp, his retinue exceeding all his predecessors,
says a correspondent of Carleton, “in the bravery
and multitude of his servants.” The following day he
wrote of the ceremony to Villiers, “There was much ado,
and a great deal of the world. But this matter of pomp,
which is heaven to some men, is hell to me, or purgatory
at least.” This expression, if not an affectation entirely,
is, at least, strangely inconsistent with the account of the
vulgar pomp and display of a <i>Feast of the Family</i>, which
is described by Bacon with so much detail in <i>The New
Atlantis</i>.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE MONUMENT OF LORD BACON
IN St. MICHAEL’S CHURCH.</div></div>

<p>In this year Bacon dared to interpose, for a fitful instant,
between Villiers and his desires; the next moment he is
reduced to a state of pathetic contrition. But the evanescent
display of a spirit of independence nearly cost the
Lord Keeper his position at Court. For purely personal
reasons Bacon regarded, with aversion, the projected marriage
between Sir John Villiers, a brother of Buckingham,
and the daughter of his old rival and enemy, Sir Edward
Coke. In a letter to the Earl of Buckingham he so far forgot
himself and his repeated promises to hold himself as a mere
instrument in the hands of the King, as to protest against
the proposed marriage. Realising immediately the folly of
this want of tact, he wrote to the King, and to Buckingham,
justifying, or rather excusing his temerity. The King replied
with a sharp rebuke, the Favourite in a short, angry note.
Further letters elicited additional curt corrections from the
angered Monarch, and from Buckingham. Bacon then,
for the first time, realised the enormity of his presumption.
His position was in danger. Excuse and justification<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
were unavailing to conciliate his angry masters; absolute
submission was the only way out of his predicament.
Bacon submitted; he even offered to put his submission
into writing to the Favourite. Buckingham, in a pencilled
note, couched in tones in which arrogance is mixed with
acrimonious reflection on “his confused and childish”
presumption, notified his forgiveness. In reply, Bacon
protested his gratitude to “my ever best Lord, now better
than yourself,” and concluded, “it is the line of my life,
and not the lines of my letter, that must express my
thankfulness; wherein, if I fail, then God fail me, and
make me as miserable, as I think myself at this time
happy, by this reviver through his Majesty’s clemency and
your incomparable love and favour.”</p>

<p>His submission nullified his early resolve not to tolerate
any attempts to interfere with the course of law, and
delivered him bodily into the hands of Buckingham.
The Favourite took the Lord Keeper at his word, and
although he put his loyalty to constant and severe tests,
by making frequent application to him in favour of chancery
suitors, Bacon never again forgot that “the lines of his
life” must progress in undeviating conformity with the
Favourite’s will. It is not profitable here to attempt to
determine whether or not he gave verdicts against his own
judgment, but we have the letters to show that he listened,
replied, and complied with Buckingham’s requests, and in
1618 he was made Lord Chancellor, doubtless by the
influence, and on the advice, of the Favourite.</p>

<p>During the period of Bacon’s temporary disgrace,
“when the King and Buckingham had set their faces
against him, and all the courtiers were yelping at his
heels,” the only friend who remained staunch and constant
to him was Sir Henry Yelverton, the Attorney-General.
Yelverton, whose admiration for, and loyalty towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Lord Chancellor were unswerving, would truckle neither
to the Favourite nor to the King; although the former had
assured him that those who opposed him “should discern
what favour he had by the power he would use.” Within
a year of Bacon’s restoration to favour Yelverton came
into collision with Buckingham, and the Attorney’s accidental
misconstruction of the King’s verbal instructions,
served as an excuse for an information to be laid against
him in the Star Chamber. We have seen how Bacon
could repay friendship with ingratitude, and kindness with
baseness in the case of Essex and of Cecil, but, in the
instance of Yelverton, even his admirers are forced to
admit that his behaviour was “peculiarly cold-blooded
and ungrateful.” But the “lines of his life” had made
him the serf of the Favourite, and “whatever other resolutions
Bacon may have broken, none can accuse him of
breaking this.” When the case came on, and when “the
bill was opened by the King’s Sergeant briefly, with tears
in his eyes, and Mr. Attorney, standing at the Bar, amid
the ordinary Counsellors, with dejected looks, weeping
tears, and a brief, eloquent, and humble oration, made a
submission, acknowledging his error, but denying the
corruption”&mdash;the Lord Chancellor did his utmost to resist
the merciful proposal of the majority to submit the
Attorney’s submission to the King. The King declined
to interfere, and the termination of the case was announced
to Buckingham by Bacon, in the following self-satisfied
and congratulatory note:&mdash;“Yesterday we made an end
of Sir Henry Yelverton’s causes. I have almost killed
myself with sitting almost eight hours. But I was
resolved to sit it through.” He then gives the terms of
the sentence, and adds: “How I stirred the Court I leave
it to others to speak; but things passed to his Majesty’s
great honour.” In other words, a blunt, straightforward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
and honourable man, who had refused to purchase his
office by bribes, or by flattery, had been condemned, on a
charge of corruption (of which his judges knew him to be
guiltless), to a fine of £4,000 and imprisonment during the
King’s pleasure, for the offence of refusing to cringe to
Buckingham. These were the things that, in Bacon’s
judgment, “passed to his Majesty’s great honour.”</p>

<p>In 1618 Bacon became Baron Verulam of Verulam;
three years later he was created Viscount St. Alban,
“with all the ceremonies of robes and coronet.” But his
disgrace and discomfiture were soon to come. “In a few
weeks,” writes Lord Macaulay, “was signally brought to
the test the value of those objects for which Bacon had
sullied his integrity, had resigned his independence, had
violated the most sacred obligations of friendship and
gratitude, had flattered the worthless, had persecuted
the innocent, had tampered with judges, had tortured
prisoners, had plundered suitors, had wasted on paltry
intrigue all the powers of the most exquisitely constructed
intellect that has ever been bestowed on any of the
children of men.” On March the 14th, 1621, Bacon was
charged by a disappointed suitor with taking money for
the dispatch of his suit. On April the 30th, in the
House of Lords, was read “the confession and humble
submission of me, the Lord Chancellor.” On May the 3rd,
the Lords came to a general conclusion that “the Lord
Chancellor is guilty of the matters wherewith he is
charged,” and it was resolved that he should be fined
£40,000, imprisoned in the Tower during the King’s
pleasure, declared incapable of any office, place, or employment
in the State or Commonwealth, and that he
should never sit in Parliament, nor come within the verge
of the Court. Five years later, on April the 9th, 1626, he
died at Highgate of a chill and sudden sickness, contracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
by exposure when stuffing a fowl with snow to test the
effect of snow in preserving flesh from putrefaction. He
wrote, on his death bed, to Lord Arundel, to whose house
he had been carried: “As for the experiment it succeeded
exceeding well.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_4"><i>Bacon and Shakespeare Contrasted.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> argument of the Baconians&mdash;the term is uniformly
employed here to mean the supporters of the
Baconian theory of the authorship of Shakespeare&mdash;is
based on the honest belief that the varied qualifications
necessary for the production of the Plays were possessed by
only one man of the period in which they were written.
And having resolutely determined that the man could be
no other than Francis Bacon, they set themselves to work
with the same resoluteness, to bend, twist, and contort all
facts and evidence to suit their theory. It is clearly
impossible to credit any of Shakespeare’s contemporary
dramatists with the authorship, because their acknowledged
work is so immeasurably inferior to his, that any such
suggestion must appear ridiculous. It is safe to assume
that no writer who had produced poems or plays inferior
to those of Shakespeare could be attributed with the
authorship of these plays&mdash;Shakespeare can only be compared
with himself. And the only author who cannot
be compared, in this way, to his instant discomfiture,
is Bacon, whose published work is, in form and style
and essence utterly dissimilar from that of Shakespeare.
If a brilliant intellect, wide knowledge, and classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
attainments were the only requisite qualifications for the
production of the greatest poetry of the world, then Bacon’s
claim would stand on a sure foundation. He was intimately
acquainted, no man better, with the philosophy of
the law; he was an eminent classical scholar, a writer of
beautiful English, compact in expression, and rich in fancy.
He had an extensive acquaintance with literature and
history, he was a brilliant orator; but unto all these great
gifts was not added the gentle nature, the broad sympathy
and knowledge of humanity, the wealth of humour, the
depth of passion, the creative power of poetry, which is so
strikingly manifested in the plays of William Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the gentleness of Shakespeare’s
nature, his uprightness, his honesty, his modesty, is disclosed
in his poems, and corroborated by the evidence
of his contemporaries. His poetry breathes the gentleness
and the lovable nature with which his personal friends
credited him. What is there in any analysis of Bacon,
beyond his marvellous mental attainments, which single
him out as the probable, even possible, creator of King
Lear, Brutus, Juliet, Rosalind, and Shylock? Coldness of
heart, and meanness of spirit, are faults of temperament
which cannot, by the greatest stretch of imagination be
associated with the author of Lear’s desolating pathos
and Arthur’s deeply pathetic appeal to Hubert. The
points in Bacon’s career, which have been dealt with in
the foregoing pages, were selected of <i>malice prepense</i>; not
to detract from the greatness of the Lord Chancellor, as
a literary genius and philosopher, but as demonstrating
the impossibility of associating such a nature with the
authorship of the poetry attributed to him. By his deeds
we know him to have been a man whose nature was largely
made up of ingratitude, untruth, flattery, meanness,
cruelty, and servility. His treatment of Essex, of Cecil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and of Yelverton, can only be stigmatised as “peculiarly
cold-blooded and ungrateful;” his persecution of Peacham
convicts him of cruelty, bordering on savageness; his
meanness is illustrated by the selfish unreasonableness
displayed by his attitude towards Trott, his long-suffering
creditor. His servile submission to Buckingham has
scarcely a parallel in English history.</p>

<p>Deep as was his mind, and profound his knowledge,
Bacon possessed no high standard of virtue or morality;
he had no intuitive knowledge of mankind, and even as
regards his dealings with the people amongst whom his life
was passed, he evidenced a singular defectiveness as a reader
of character. The sweeping generalities of his observations
would be a poor stock-in-trade for a writer of melodrama.
In his books he exhibits the cunning, the casuistry and
unscrupulousness of an Elizabethan politician and time
server. His advice and his opinions betray a mean view
of life and its obligations. He had no sense of duty
towards his fellow men where duty clashed with his
personal interests. His methods are instinct with craft,
artifice, and finesse&mdash;his advice to Essex, and to the King,
was, for this very reason, misleading and abortive. It is
incontrovertible that Bacon’s writings and Shakespeare’s
plays are crammed with all kinds of erudition, and Coleridge
has claimed for the latter that they form “an inexhaustible
mine of virgin wealth.” But not a single argument
can be advanced to show that Shakespeare could not
easily have acquired such erudition and scholarship as the
writing of the plays entailed, while we have all the books
of Bacon to prove that the poetic genius, the colossal
personality, the deep, intense appreciation of nature, and
the unrivalled knowledge of man, which are the sovereign
mark of the Plays, were not possessed by Bacon.</p>

<p>In editing the existing biographies of Lord Bacon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
bolster up their theory, the Baconians have only conformed
to the laws of absolute necessity. The cold,
unvarnished facts that have been set forth in the foregoing
pages are so contrary to the popular impression of what
constitutes a “concealed poet,” that a more than ordinary
amount of colorisation was required to make them acceptable
in the author of <i>The Tempest</i>. But although there is
reasonable excuse, and even some justification for this
rose-colorisation process as applied to Bacon&mdash;for great men
have almost invariably been given, by their biographers,
the greatest benefit that be derived from all doubts&mdash;the
champions of Bacon have far exceeded their prerogative in
their attempts to defame and belittle Shakespeare. So
much incorrect deduction, so much groundless suspicion,
and so much palpable inaccuracy have been put forward
by the Baconians, that it is imperative the few known
facts in the poet’s life should be clearly stated. The
following sketch is frankly intended, not so much to
support the claim of Shakespeare as the author of the
Plays, as to refute the many misconceptions and untruths
by which his enemies have endeavoured to traduce him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_5"><i>Baconian Fallacies Respecting Shakespeare.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is only necessary to read the facts concerning Shakespeare’s
ancestry and parentage to dissipate some of
the absurd suggestions as to the obscurity and illiteracy of
the family. The poet came of good yeoman stock, and
his forebears to the fourth and fifth generation were fairly
substantial landowners. John Shakespeare, his father,
was at one period of his life a prosperous trader in
Stratford-on-Avon. He played a prominent part in
municipal affairs, and became successively Town Councillor,
Alderman, one of the chamberlains of the borough,
and auditor of the municipal accounts. The assertion
that he could not write is a distinct perversion of fact, as
“there is evidence in the Stratford archives that he could
write with facility.”</p>

<p>On the subject of the education of William Shakespeare
it is inevitable that there should be conflicting opinions.
Those who would deck out the memory of Bacon with
the literary robe, “the garment which,” according to Mr.
R.&nbsp;M. Theobald, is “too big and costly” for the “small
and insignificant personality” of Shakespeare, will not
concede that he was better educated than his father, who&mdash;the
error does not lose for want of repetition&mdash;“signed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
his name by a mark.” Supporters of the traditional theory,
however, reply, “we do not require evidence to show that
he was an educated man&mdash;we have his works, and the
evidence of Ben Jonson, John Heming, and Henry Condell
to prove it.” Mr. Theobald argues that because there is
no positive proof that he had any school education, it is
logical to conclude that he had none. Mr. A.&nbsp;P. Sinnett,
with the same reckless disregard for facts, says, “We
know that he (William Shakespeare) was the son of a
tradesman at Stratford, who could not read or write.” And
in another place, “there is no rag of evidence that he
(William Shakespeare) ever went to school.” Mr. W.&nbsp;H.
Mallock describes him, still without “a rag of evidence” to
support his assertion, as “a notoriously ill-educated actor,
who seems to have found some difficulty in signing his own
name.” All evidence we have to guide us on this point
of Shakespeare’s schooling is that he was entitled to free
tuition at the Grammar School at Stratford, which was
re-constituted on a mediæval foundation by Edward VI.
As the son of a prominent and prosperous townsman, he
would, for a moral certainty, have been sent by his father
to school (Mr. Sidney Lee favours the probability that he
entered the school in 1571), where he would receive the
ordinary instruction of the time in the Latin language and
literature. The fact that the French passages in <i>Henry
V.</i> are grammatically correct, but are not idiomatic,
makes it certain that they were written by a school-taught
linguist, and not by a man like Bacon, who, from his
lengthy residence on the Continent, must have been a
master of colloquial, idiomatic French. Ben Jonson, in
his profound, and somewhat self-conscious command of
classical knowledge, spoke slightingly of Shakespeare’s
“small Latin and less Greek,” which is all that his plays
would lead us to credit him with. His liberal use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
translations, and his indebtedness to North’s translations
of <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i>, also substantiates this theory.</p>

<p>We cannot regard, as a great scholar, an author who
“gives Bohemia a coast line, makes Cleopatra play
billiards, mixes his Latin, and mulls his Greek.” Mr.
Reginald Haines, who has made a study of Shakespeare
for the express purpose of testing his classical attainments,
denies emphatically that he shows any acquaintance with
Greek at all. His conclusions are worthy of consideration:
“Of course there are common allusions to Greek
history and mythology such as every poet would have at
command, but no reference at first hand to any Greek
writer.... As far as I know there are but four real Greek
words to be found in Shakespeare’s works&mdash;<i>threne</i>, <i>cacodemon</i>,
<i>practic</i>, and <i>theoric</i>. It is impossible to suppose
that Bacon could have veiled his classical knowledge so
successfully in so extensive a field for its display, or that
he could, for instance, have perpetrated such a travesty of
Homer as appears in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. With Latin,
the case is somewhat different. Shakespeare certainly
knew a little grammar-school Latin. He was familiar
with Ovid, and even quotes him in the original; and he
certainly knew Virgil, and Seneca, Cæsar, and something
of Terence and Horace, and, as I myself believe, of
Juvenal. But he very rarely quotes Latin, unless it be
a proverb or some stock quotation from Mantuanus or a
tag from a Latin grammar. When he uses conversational
Latin, as in <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, the idiom is shaky. The
quotations from Horace, &amp;c., in <i>Titus Andronicus</i> are
certainly not by Shakespeare. Nor are the Latinisms like
“palliament” in that play. Still he has a very large
vocabulary of Latin words such as <i>renege</i>, to <i>gust</i> (taste),
and we may fairly say that Shakespeare knew Latin as
well as many sixth form boys, but not as a scholar.” Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
years ago a writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, who had gone
through all the alleged examples of erudition and evidences
of wide and accurate classical scholarship in the Shakespearean
plays, showed them to be entirely imaginary.</p>

<p>In 1582, before he was nineteen years of age, Shakespeare
married Anne Hathaway, and three years afterwards he
left Stratford for London. It was during this period, says
Mr. Theobald, that “the true Shakespeare was studying
diligently, and filling his mind with those vast stores of
learning&mdash;classic, historic, legal, scientific&mdash;which bare such
splendid fruit in his after life.” As Mr. Theobald’s contention
is that Bacon was the “true Shakespeare,” let us
consider for a moment how young Francis was employing
his abilities at this particular time. In 1579 he returned
to England after a two years’ residence in France. He
had revealed an early disposition to extend his studies
beyond the ordinary limits of literature, and to read the
smallest print of the book of nature. He was already
importuning his uncle, Lord Burghley, for some advancement
which might enable him to dispense with the
monotonous routine of legal studies. Failing in this
endeavour, he was admitted as a barrister of Gray’s Inn,
was elected to Parliament for Melcombe Regis, composed
his first philosophical work, which he named “with great
confidence, and a magnificent title,” <i>The Greatest Birth of
Time</i>, and another treatise entitled, <i>Advice to Queen
Elizabeth</i>. In the case of the poet we have no record; in
that of the future Lord Chancellor we get the key of the
nature which rendered the man as “incapable of writing

<p>William Beeston, a 17th century actor, has left it on
record that, after leaving Stratford, Shakespeare was for
a time a country schoolmaster. In 1586 he arrived in
London. His only friend in the Metropolis was Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Field, a fellow townsman, whom he sought out, and with
whom, as publisher, he was shortly to be associated. It
is uncertain when Shakespeare joined the Lord Chamberlain’s
company of actors, but documentary evidence proves
that he was a member of it in 1594, and that in 1603,
after the accession of James I., when they were called the
King’s Players, he was one of its leaders. This company
included among its chief members Shakespeare’s life-long
friends, Richard Burbage, John Heming, Henry Condell,
and Augustine Phillips, and it was under their auspices
that his plays first saw the light.</p>

<p>Before they opened at the Rose on the Bankside,
Southwark, in 1592, the Lord Chamberlain’s company had
played at The Theatre in Shoreditch, and in 1599 they
opened at the Globe, which was afterwards the only theatre
with which Shakespeare was professionally associated. In
this year he acquired an important share in the profits of
the company, and his name appears first on the list of those
who took part in the original performance of Ben Jonson’s
<i>Every Man in His Humour</i>. Mr. Theobald states that
Shakespeare had become a fairly prosperous theatre
manager in 1592, but as he did not secure his interest
in the business until seven years later, what probably is
meant is that Shakespeare was combining the duties of
stage manager, acting manager, and treasurer of the
theatre. It would appear that, recognising the fact that
the period in Shakespeare’s life between 1588 and 1592
is a blank “which no research can fill up,” Mr. Theobald
considers that he is justified in making good the deficiency
out of his own inner consciousness.</p>

<p>As occasion will require that Mr. Theobald’s contribution
to the controversy shall presently be dealt with, it
may not be out of place here to explain the object, so far
as it is intelligible, of his <i>Shakespeare Studies in Baconian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Light</i> (Sampson Low, 1901). It would have been a fair
thing to assume that the design of the author of this
volume of over 500 pages, was to prove the Baconian
authorship of Shakespeare, but as Mr. Theobald has since
written to the Press to protest against this interpretation
of his motives, we must take his words as he gives his
parallels “for what they are worth.” In the opening
lines of his preface, Mr. Theobald declares that while the
greatest name in the world’s literature is Shakespeare,
there is in the world’s literature no greater name than
Bacon. Really, it would seem that if his object is not
to prove that the two names stand for one and the same
individual, this statement is sheer nonsense. Before the
end of the preface is reached, he frankly avows his belief
that “when the time comes for a general recognition of
Bacon as the true Shakespeare, the poetry will still be
called “Shakespeare,” and that no one will find anything
compromising in such language, any more than we do
when we refer to George Eliot or George Sand, meaning
Miss Evans or Madame Dudevant.” But if Mr. Theobald
was as versed in his study of the subject as Mrs. Gallup,
Dr. Owen, Mr. A.&nbsp;P. Sinnett, or even Bacon himself, he
would know that when this general recognition comes to
pass the author of the Plays will not be called Shakespeare,
or Bacon, but Francis “Tidder, or Tudor”&mdash;otherwise
Francis I. of England&mdash;provided, of course,
that the bi-literallists can substantiate their cipher. But
as Mr. Theobald does not design to prove the Baconian
theory, he does not, of course, require the evidence of the
great Chancellor, or he may, as a disparager of cipher
speculations, accept such evidence “for what it is worth.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_6"><i>Mr. Theobald, a Baconian by Intuition.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Mr</span>. Theobald’s “preliminaries” are chiefly remarkable
for three diverse reasons. We learn therefrom
that he is a Baconian by intuition&mdash;“the persuasion
took hold of his mind” as soon as Holme’s <i>Authorship of
Shakespeare</i> was placed in his hand&mdash;that he does not
admit the existence of genius, and that he is intolerant
of “clamours and asperities, denunciations and vituperations,”
and the personal abuse employed by anti-Baconians,
whom he alludes to as Hooligans, and
compares with geese. So long as he keeps to the
trodden path of Baconian argument, he is only about
as perverse and incorrect as the rest of&mdash;to use his
own expression as applied to Shakespearean students&mdash;“the
clan.” But he becomes amusing when he ventures
to present new arguments in support of Bacon’s claim,
variously abusive in his references to Shakespeare, and
desperately dogmatic in his pronouncement of the faith
that is in him.</p>

<p>“Among the many shallow objections brought against
the Baconian theory,” writes Mr. Theobald in his chapter
on Bacon’s literary output, “one is founded on the
assumption that Bacon was a voluminous writer, and that
if we add to his avowed literary productions, the Shakespearean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
dramas, he is loaded with such a stupendous
literary progeny as no author could possibly generate.
Moreover, he was so busy in state business as a lawyer,
judge, counsellor, member of Parliament, confidential
adviser to the King, and the responsible rulers in State and
Church, that he had very little spare time for authorship.”</p>

<p class="smaller">From the original, in the collection of
The Right Hon<sup>ble</sup> the Earl of Verulam.</p></div></div>

<p>In order to demonstrate that this shallow objection, as
Mr. Theobald calls it, is a well-founded and irrefutable
statement of fact, we have only to refer to Lord Bacon’s
life and to his letters. From 1579, when he returned from
France, until the end of his life he was distracted between
politics and science; he put forward as his reason for
seeking office that he might thereby be able to help on
his philosophic projects which with him were paramount,
and the poignant regret of his last years was that he
had allowed himself to be diverted from philosophy into
politics. He found “no work so meritorious,” so serviceable
to mankind, “as the discovery and development of
the arts and inventions that tend to civilise the life of
men.” In his letter to Lord Burghley in 1592, he expressed
the hope that in the service of the State he could “bring
in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and
profitable inventions and discoveries&mdash;the best state of
that province”&mdash;the province embracing all nature which
he had made his own. But office was denied him, and he
returned to “business” and to his constant bewailings of
the fact that he had no time for literature. In 1607 he
settled the plan of the <i>Instauratio Magna</i>; which had
been foreshadowed in his <i>Advancement of Learning</i>,
published two years previously. In 1609 he wrote to Toby
Mathew, “My <i>Instauratio</i> sleeps not,” and again, in the
same year, “My great work goeth forward; and after my
manner I alter ever when I add; so that nothing is
finished till all is finished.” From 1609 to 1620 Bacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
spent such leisure as he could snatch from his other work
in revising the <i>Novum Organum</i> (the second part of his
<i>Magna Instauratio</i>), of which his chaplain, Rawley, says
that he had seen “at least twelve copies revised year
by year, one after another, and amended in the frame
thereof.” In 1620, when the <i>Novum Organum</i> was
published, the author sent it into the world uncompleted,
because he had begun to number his days, and “would
have it saved.” This was the book he alluded to as “my
great work”&mdash;the work of his life, and he issued it as a
fragment because he had not been able to find time to
finish it. The belief that he had “very little spare time
for authorship” is no shallow objection brought against
the Baconian theory&mdash;it is an irrefutable fact, proved not
only out of the mouth, but in the life, of Lord Bacon.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of all positive evidence to the
contrary, Mr. Theobald proceeds to bolster up his contention
that Bacon had time, and to spare, for literary
pursuits, by the following most amazing piece of logic.
He contends, in the first place, that “an estimate of the
entire literary output of Bacon, as a scientific and philosophical
writer, proves the amount to be really somewhat
small.” He takes the fourteen volumes of Spedding’s
<i>Life and Works</i>, subtracts the prefaces, notes, editorial
comments, and the biographical narrative, puts aside as of
“no literary significance whatever,” all business letters,
speeches, State papers, etc., and thus reduces the total
amount of literature to Bacon’s credit in the seven
volumes devoted to the <i>Life</i> to some 375 pages. “If we
calculate the whole amount contained in the fourteen
volumes, we shall find it may be reckoned at about six such
volumes, each containing 520 pages. On this method of
calculation and selection, all that Mr. Theobald can find,
“for his whole life, amounts to about 70 pages per annum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
less than six pages a month.” Turning from Bacon to
Shakespeare, Mr. Theobald finds that here again is a man
whose literary output has been greatly exaggerated, for “if
the Shakespeare poetry was the only work of William
Shakespeare, certainly he was not a voluminous writer.
<i>Thirty-one years may be taken as a moderate estimate of the
duration of his literary life, i.e., from 1585 till his death in
1616.</i> And the result is 37 plays and the minor poems&mdash;not
two plays for each year.” Mr. Theobald, it will be
seen, possesses the same weakness for statistics that Mr.
Dick evinced for King Charles’ head; he drops in his
little estimate in season and out of season, and his
appraisements are as manifold as they are fallacious. The
period of Shakespeare’s dramatic output was confined to
twenty years, from 1591 to 1611&mdash;if he had continued
writing plays till his death in 1616, Bacon’s alleged
playwriting would not have ceased with such significant
suddenness in 1611. But what conclusion does Mr.
Theobald arrive at as the result of his estimates? No less
than this, that if the whole of Shakespeare, and the whole
of Bacon’s acknowledged works belong to the same author,
“the writer was not a voluminous author&mdash;<i>not by any
means so voluminous as Miss Braddon</i> or Sir Walter Scott.”
That Mr. Theobald should not hesitate to class Miss
Braddon’s novels with the plays of Shakespeare, which
belong to the supreme rank of literature, or even with
Bacon’s “royal mastery of language never surpassed,
never perhaps equalled,” is the most astounding link in
this astounding chain of so-called evidence. But Mr.
Theobald advances it with the utmost confidence. “Therefore,”
he sums up, “let this objection stand aside; it
vanishes into invisibility as soon as it is accurately tested”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
weighed up, like groceries, by the pound.</p>

<p>Mr. Theobald is scarcely complimentary to Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
champions in this controversy, but his language is positively
libellous when he refers to Shakespeare himself. His
personality is “small and insignificant;”&mdash;he is a “shrunken,
sordid soul, fattening on beer, and coin, and finding
sweetness and content in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">stercorarium</i> of his Stratford
homestead”&mdash;a “feeble, and funny, and most ridiculous
mouse.” Mr. Theobald almost argues himself not a
Baconian by his assertion that “no Baconian, so far as I
know, seeks to help his cause by personal abuse, or
intolerant and wrathful speech.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_7"><i>Was Shakespeare the “Upstart Crow?”</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">All</span> that we can allege with any certainty about
Shakespeare, between 1586 and 1602, is that he must
have obtained employment at one or other of the only two
theatres existing in London at that time (The Theatre,
and The Curtain)&mdash;perhaps, as Malone has recorded, in
the capacity of call-boy&mdash;that he became an actor, was
employed in polishing up the stock-plays presented by the
Company, and that <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> was produced in
the Spring of 1591. Assuming that Shakespeare was the
author of this play&mdash;assuming, that is to say, that Ben
Jonson, John Heming, and Henry Condell were neither
arrant fools, nor wilful perjurers&mdash;it is evident that the
“insignificant,” “shrunken, sordid soul,” “this ridiculous
mouse” had education, application, a natural taste for the
stage; and what is more&mdash;and more than Mr. Theobald
can comprehend&mdash;he had genius. Mr. Theobald does not
arrive at any such conclusion. Apart altogether from Mrs.
Gallup’s cipher revelations, he is convinced by another
“flash of intuition” that Ben Jonson was a fellow conspirator
with Bacon in the ridiculous plot of foisting
Bacon’s plays upon the world as the work of Shakespeare,
and that Heming and Condell were but the tools of the
disgraced Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
But if Shakespeare was not advancing towards prosperity
by the feasible methods I have conjectured, how
can Mr. Theobald account for his ultimately emerging
from the “depths of poverty” into a position of comparative
affluence? The explanation is simplicity itself:
“If a needy, and probably deserving vagabond” (page 11).&mdash;Why
deserving? He was a “shrunken, sordid soul” on
page 7!&mdash;“dives into the abyss of London life, lies <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perdu</i>
for a few years, and then emerges as a tolerably wealthy
theatrical manager; you know that he must have gained
some mastery of theatrical business.” So far the inference
is legitimate and convincing; but how? Must he not have
disclosed exceptional ability as an actor or playwright, or&mdash;?
listen to Mr. Theobald!&mdash;“he must have made himself a
useful man in the green room, a skilful organiser of players
and stage effects&mdash;he must have found out how to govern
a troop of actors, reconciling their rival egotisms, and
utilising their special gifts; how to cater for a capricious
public, and provide attractive entertainments. Anyhow,
he would have little time for other pursuits&mdash;if a student
at all, his studies would be very practical relating to
matters of present or passing interest. <i>During this dark
period he has been carving his own fortune, filling his pockets,
not his mind; working for the present, not for the future.
But it was exactly then that the plays began to appear.</i>”</p>

<p>Mr. Theobald’s argument can only be described as a
reckless, illogical, and absurd distortion of possibilities,
and it is the more inconsequential since it proceeds to
defeat its primary object. In the first place it is supremely
ridiculous to assume that the paltry services of Shakespeare
in the green room and the carpenter’s shop, secured
for him his pecuniary interest in the Globe Theatre, or the
respect and friendship of the leading dramatists of his
day, or even the enmity of jealous rivals in the craft. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Mr. Theobald attempts to substantiate his conclusions by
distorting the obvious meaning of Robt. Greene’s reference
to Shakespeare in <i>A Groat’s Worth of Wit</i>. Greene was
not an actor, but a dramatist; he was a man of dissolute
habits, a poet of rare charm, but a playwright of only
moderate ability and repute. He was a gentleman by
birth, and a scholar by training. He had the lowest
opinion of actors&mdash;he envied them their success, and
despised their avocation. In <i>The Return from Parnassus</i>
he betrays his prejudice in the following lines, which are
put into the mouth of a poor and envious <span class="locked">student:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“England affords these glorious vagabonds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That carried erst their fardels on their backs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coursers to ride on through the gazing streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeping it in their glaring satin suits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pages to attend their masterships;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mouthing words that better wits had framed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They purchase lands, and now esquires are made.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>To the jaundiced mind of Robert Greene, the accumulation
of means by an actor was a crime in itself, but that a
mere mummer should dare to compete with the scholar and
the poet in the composition of plays&mdash;more, that he should
write plays that exceeded in popularity those of the superior
person, the student&mdash;was a personal affront. On his death-bed,
in 1592, Greene found an outlet for his resentment in
writing an ill-natured farewell to life, in which he girded
bitterly at the new dramatist, whose early plays had already
brought him into public notice. He warns his three
brother playwrights&mdash;Marlowe, Nash, and Peele&mdash;against
the “upstart crow, the only Shake-scene in the country”
who “supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blanke
verse as the best of you.” How it is possible to interpret
these words to mean that the “upstart crow” was not an
author, “but only an actor who pretended to be an author
also,” the oldest inhabitant of Colney Hatch and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Theobald must decide between them. These anything but
“cryptic” words, as Mr. Theobald describes them, can
have but one interpretation, and that is the one their
author intended. They do not imply that Shakespeare,
the “upstart crow,” is not the author of the plays imputed
to him, but that he considers his plays as good as those of
the older dramatists. His profession of authorship is
not questioned, but the quality of his work is savagely
challenged. Any other construction put upon the passage
is sheer nonsense. Mr. Theobald appeals to the “most
gentle and gentlemanly critics” to be patient and tolerant
with the Baconians&mdash;“men as sound in judgment and
as well equipped in learning as yourselves”&mdash;but it is
high time that this kind of wilful misrepresentation and
perversion of common sense should be condemned in
plain language. If Greene had believed that Shakespeare
was wearing feathers that did not rightfully belong to him,
if he were pretending to be what he really was not; if, in
Mr. Theobald’s confident explanation, he had no right to
profess himself an author at all, we may be quite certain
that Greene would have said so outright&mdash;he would not
have adopted a “cryptic” style, and left it for Mr.
Theobald to decipher his meaning.</p>

<p>Mr. Theobald’s alternative theory that the word “Shake-scene”
does not refer to Shakespeare at all, is even more
preposterous. “In 1592 ‘Shakespeare’ did not exist at
all, and only two or three of the plays which subsequently
appeared under this name could have been written.”
But those two or three plays included, as far as we can
tell, <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, and
<i>The Comedy of Errors</i>&mdash;plays of sufficient promise to
secure any author recognition as a poet and dramatist.
If Mr. Theobald entertains any serious doubts as to the
identification of Shakespeare in the “Shake-scene” of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Greene, he may be advised to read the apology for this
attack which Henry Chettle, the publisher, prefixed to a
tract of Greene’s in the same year. “I am as sorry,”
Chettle wrote, “as if the originall fault had been my
fault, because myselfe have seene his (<i>i.e.</i>, Shakespeare’s)
demeanour no lesse civill than he (is) exelent in the
qualitie he professes, besides divers of worship have
reported his uprightness of dealing, which argues his
honesty and his facetious grace in writing that aprooves
his art.”</p>

Verulam.</p>

<p>“For my name and memory I leave it to men’s charitable speeches, and to foreign
nations, and the next ages.”</p></div></div>

<p>This apology put forth by Henry Chettle is an invaluable
attestation to the character and literary standing of
Shakespeare&mdash;“his uprightness in dealing” is a matter of
public report, and “his facetious grace in writing” is
frankly acknowledged. At a period when professional
rivalries ran strong, and no man’s reputation was above
attack, a publisher and fellow author is seen regarding
Shakespeare not only as a man to whom an apology was
due, but to whom it appeared expedient to make one. In
treating of the personal history of Shakespeare, it must
be borne in mind that although the duly-attested facts
regarding him are regrettably few, the poet was widely
known to the leading literary and theatrical men of
his day. Ben Jonson, his brother actor and dramatist,
and Michael Drayton were his intimate friends. Condell
and Heming remained in close relationship with Shakespeare
until his death, and Richard Burbage was his
partner in the business of the Globe Theatre. In <i>Pericles</i>
and <i>Timon</i>, Shakespeare worked in collaboration with
George Wilkins, a dramatic writer of some repute, and
William Rowley, a professional reviser of plays. There
were besides, the members of the Globe Company, men
who lived their lives beside him, rehearsed under him,
learned from him, interpreted him. Yet none of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
men appear to have entertained the slightest doubt upon
the genuineness of his claims to authorship, while every
contemporaneous reference to him is couched in terms
of affection and admiration. The only possible explanation
of this remarkable fact is that Shakespeare and Bacon
were one and the same person&mdash;a theory that the most
hardened Baconian has not yet thought it advisable to
advance.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Mr</span>. Theobald is unfortunate in his selection of
the points he raises in Shakespeare’s career in order
to belittle the character of the poet. He writes: “His
known occupations, apart from theatre business, were
money-lending, malt-dealing, transactions in house and
land property.” There is not the slightest evidence to show
that Shakespeare traded as a money-lender; his only
interest in malt-dealing was confined to one transaction,
and his transactions in houses and lands were those of any
man who invests his savings in real estate. The phrase is,
as the most superficial Shakespeare student will recognise,
misleading in substance, and incorrect as a statement of
fact. In another part of his determinedly one-sided book,
Mr. Theobald dismisses, in a paragraph, the contention that
Shakespeare’s poems are illuminated and illustrated by
Shakespeare’s life. The obvious rejoinder is that there
is nothing in the life of Shakespeare that makes it difficult
for us to accept him as the author of the Plays, whereas
the whole life and character of Bacon makes his pretensions
more than difficult, even impossible, of acceptance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
In 1593, <i>Venus and Adonis</i> was published by Shakespeare’s
friend and fellow townsman, Richard Field, and in
the following year <i>Lucrece</i> was issued at the sign of the
White Greyhound in St. Paul’s Churchyard. Both poems
were dedicated to Shakespeare’s first and only patron,
the Earl of Southampton, with whom Bacon is not
known to have sought any intimacy until 1603, when he
addressed to him a characteristic letter of conciliation.
(In 1621, when Bacon was accused of corruption, the Earl
of Southampton pointed out the insufficiency of the Lord
Chancellor’s original confession, and it was largely the
result of his firm and unfriendly attitude that Bacon’s
abject submission and acknowledgment of the justice of
the charges, was placed before the Lords). These poems
constituted Shakespeare’s appeal to the reading public.
The response was instantaneous and enthusiastic. “Critics
vied with each other,” writes Mr. Sidney Lee, “in the
exuberance of the eulogies, in which they proclaimed that
the fortunate author had gained a place in permanence on
the summit of Parnassus.” <i>Lucrece</i>, Michael Drayton
declared, in his <i>Legend of Matilda</i> (1594), was “revived to
live another age.” In 1595, William Clerke, in his
<i>Polimanteia</i>, gave “all praise” to “Sweet Shakespeare”
for his <i>Lucrecia</i>. John Weever, in a sonnet addressed to
“honey-tongued” Shakespeare in his <i>Epigrams</i> (1595),
eulogised the two poems as an unmatchable achievement,
although he mentions the plays <i>Romeo</i>, and <i>Richard</i>,
and “more whose names I know not.” Richard Carew,
at the same time, classed him with Marlowe, as deserving
the praises of an English Catullus. Printers and publishers
of the poems strained their resources to satisfy the
demands of eager purchasers. No fewer than seven
editions of <i>Venus</i> appeared between 1594 and 1602; an
eighth followed in 1617. <i>Lucrece</i> achieved a fifth edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
in the year of Shakespeare’s death. The Queen quickly
showed him special favour, and until her death in 1603,
Shakespeare’s plays were repeatedly acted in her presence.</p>

<p>When the sonneteering vogue reached England from
Italy and France, Shakespeare applied himself to the
composition of sonnets, with all the force of his poetic
genius. Of the hundred and fifty-four sonnets that
survive, the greater number were probably composed in
1593 and 1594. Many are so burdened with conceits and
artificial quibbles that their literary value is scarcely
discernible; but the majority, on the other hand, attain
to supreme heights of poetic expression, sweetness, and
imagery. They are of peculiar interest, as disclosing
the relationship that existed between Southampton and
Shakespeare. No less than twenty of the sonnets are
undisguisedly addressed to the patron of the poet’s verse:
three of them are poetical transcriptions of the devotion
which he expressed to Southampton in his dedicatory
preface to <i>Lucrece</i>. The references are direct and unmistakable.
In 1603, when the accession of James I. opened
the gates of Southampton’s prison, Bacon was meekly
writing to him: “I would have been very glad to have
presented my humble service to your Lordship by my
attendance if I could have foreseen that it should not have
been unpleasing to you,” and hypocritically assuring him,
“How credible soever it may seem to you at first, yet it is
as true as a thing God knoweth, that this great change
(<i>i.e.</i>, the release of Southampton, and his favour with the
new monarch, whose good-will Bacon ardently desired),
hath wrought in me no other change towards your Lordship
than this, that I may safely be now that which I was
truly before.” The Earl of Southampton considered these
protestations of friendship so incredible, as coming from
the man who had consigned Essex, Bacon’s own friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
and patron, to the headsman, and sent Southampton
himself to the Tower, that he appears to have made no
response to this letter, and twenty years afterwards he
materially contributed to the Lord Chancellor’s discomfiture.
One has only to compare this letter with the
sonnet with which Shakespeare saluted his patron on his
release from the Tower, to recognise the impossibility of
regarding the two compositions as the work of the same
man.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_9"><i>The “True Shakespeare.”</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> Bacon was the “true Shakespeare,” as Mr. Theobald
calls him, the question naturally arises as to his motive
in concealing the authorship of the plays and the poems.
Baconians explain this extraordinary act of reticence on
the ground that dramatic authorship was held in low
esteem, and that the fact, if known, would have proved
an obstacle to his advancement at Court. This contention,
though fully borne out by Bacon’s cipher writings, is
ridiculous in the extreme. In the first place, it was not
the profession of dramatic authorship, but the calling of
the actor that was held in low esteem. Furthermore,
poetry was not under the ban that attached to the stage,
and it cannot be denied that the acknowledged authorship
of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, of <i>Lucrece</i>, or of the <i>Sonnets</i>, would
have won for Bacon more favour at Elizabeth’s Court
than he ever secured by his philosophy. Poetry was held
in high esteem; sonneteering was the vogue. Buckingham,
in the next reign, wrote a play, <i>The Rehearsal</i>, and Essex
had composed a masque. The publication of <i>The Faerie
Queene</i>, in 1589, secured for Edmund Spenser an introduction
to the Queen, who made him her poet laureate in
the same year. Why should Bacon have persisted in
devoting himself to a branch of literature which appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
to have advanced his interests so little? Elizabeth was
never impressed by his genius; she acknowledged his
great wit and learning, but accounted him “not deep.”
James criticised his philosophy with lofty captiousness,
and compared his <i>Novum Organum</i> to “the peace of God,
which passeth all understanding.” It would be neither
discreditable to his pride as a poet, nor contrary to the
nature of the man, to believe that if he could safely
have claimed the authorship of <i>Lucrece</i> and <i>A Midsummer
Night’s Dream</i>, he would not have hesitated for an hour in
so doing. <i>Venus and Adonis</i> won for Shakespeare the
favour of Elizabeth, while, under the sovereignty of her
successor, Shakespeare’s company gave between forty and
fifty performances at Court during the first five years of
his reign. Is it not rather absurd to believe that Bacon
should have remained quiescent while his unavowed work
was being acclaimed as “immortal,” and the works
published under his own name were either neglected, or
treated to a contemptuous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mot</i> by the very person whose
admiration he was feverishly striving to attract?</p>

<p>Yet the Baconians find no difficulty in accepting this
explanation of secrecy&mdash;Mr. A.&nbsp;P. Sinnett regards the
motive as perfectly intelligible. Bacon, he contends, was
not writing his plays for fame, but for the money it brought
him. Mr. Theobald contends that the plays could not
have been written by Shakespeare because he was too
busily employed in “carving his own fortune” ...
“filling his pockets” ... “working for the present,
not for the future,” to devote the necessary leisure to
literary pursuits. Bacon himself, according to the bi-literal
cipher discoveries of Mrs. Gallup, declares that so
far from receiving remuneration for his plays, he paid “a
sufficient reward in gold” to Shakespeare for the use of
his name. “He was left quite without resources,” Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Sinnett explains, “and he took up dramatic writing for
the sake of the money it earned him.” Before we are won
over by this fallacious explanation, we would inquire how
it was that Bacon, who was left without resources in 1577,
did not produce his first play until 1591, and then paid for
the luxury of concealing his indiscretion. Mr. Sinnett’s
next sentence is instructive as a specimen of Baconian
reasoning. “After Bacon obtained an office of profit at
forty-six, no more Shakespeare plays appeared, though the
reputed author lived for ten more years in dignified leisure
at Stratford.” It may, of course, be regarded as a
“shallow objection” to raise, but Bacon was fifty-one
years of age when Shakespeare retired to Stratford.
Moreover, Bacon obtained no office of profit in 1611. He
was made Solicitor-General, and became a rich man, in
1607, but until his appointment to the Attorney-Generalship
in 1613 he was continually suing for promotion and
applying for a better paid office. It is, indeed, significant
that Bacon was silent as a playwright from the time of
Shakespeare’s retirement. When he was Chancellor, and
enjoyed a yearly income equal to between £60,000 and
£70,000 of our money, he continued to compose his
scientific works, and he was still actively engaged in the
task between 1621 and 1626 when he was again reduced
to comparative penury, and the more remunerative employment
of play-writing would have relieved his financial
position without detriment to his political prospects.
The source from whence he could have augmented his
inadequate income was neglected while he employed
himself in writing a <i>Digest of the Laws of England</i>, <i>The
History of Henry VII.</i>, <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i>, <i>Augmentis Scientiarum</i>,
<i>The Dialogue of the Holy War</i>, some additional
<i>Essays</i>, and the translation of “certain Psalms into English
verse.” Bacon, according to Baconians, produced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
plays during the busiest period of his political career,
and in the days of his leisure and impecuniosity&mdash;“when
Shakespeare was not present to shield him from the
disgrace of possessing poetic and dramatic genius”&mdash;he
produced his versification of the Psalms.</p>

<p>Mr. Sinnett, in common with Mr. Theobald and, indeed,
all other upholders of the Baconian theory, has a distinctly
original way of dealing with matters of fact. Mr.
Theobald invents his facts to suit his argument; Mr.
Sinnett ignores all facts that prove intractable. Thus
Mr. Sinnett in <i>The National Review</i>: “All through the
plays there is no allusion to Stratford.” And again:
“While Bacon seems to have gone North to curry favour
with James on his accession, <i>Macbeth</i> was written just after
that event. Certainly there is no reason to suppose that
Shakespeare ever went to Scotland.” What nonsense
is all this! Although personalities are rare in the Plays,
there are a number of literal references to Stratford, and
Shakespeare’s native county, in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>;
and local allusions are also to be found in the second part
of <i>Henry IV.</i> and <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>. In his
<i>Life of William Shakespeare</i>, Mr. Lee enumerates several
instances in point. “Barton Heath,” we read is, “Barton-on-the-Heath,
the home of Shakespeare’s aunt, Edmund
Lambert’s wife, and of her sons. The tinker, in <i>The Taming
of the Shrew</i>, confesses that he has run up a score with
Marian Hacket, the fat ale wife of Wincot. The references
to Wincot and the Hackets are singularly precise. The
name of the maid of the inn is given as Cicely Hacket,
and the ale-house is described in the stage direction as
‘on a heath.’” Again, in <i>Henry IV.</i>, the local reference
to William Visor, of Woncot, and the allusions to the
region of the Cotswold Hills, and the peculiar Cotswold
custom of sowing “red lammas” wheat at an unusually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
early season of the agricultural year, are unmistakable.
Mr. Sinnett’s assumptions that Bacon went to Scotland
and that Shakespeare did not, are entirely arbitrary. In
point of fact we may be quite sure that Bacon did not
go to Scotland, and we have no reason to believe that
Shakespeare was ever in Venice, or Sardis, or “a wood
near Athens.” The author of the <i>Letters from Hell</i> was
not under suspicion because he could not claim to have
been ferried across the Styx to get his local colour.</p>

<p>If we are to accept the Baconian opinion of Shakespeare
it is difficult to understand how Bacon came to allow him
to make a successful application on behalf of his father,
John Shakespeare, to the College of Heralds for a grant
of arms in 1597. Bacon was an aristocrat and a firm
believer in his order. If he knew Shakespeare to be a
notoriously ill-educated actor, a man little better than a
vagabond, an impostor, a villain with “some humour,”
whom Bacon employed as the original model for Sir John
Falstaffe and Sir Toe-be&mdash;as Mr. Harold Bayley states&mdash;why
did he not prevent his intimate friend, the Earl of
Essex, the Earl of Southampton, and William Camden,
the great scholar and antiquary, from being hoaxed by
this impudent rogue, and prevent the Shakespeares from
obtaining the desired grant? These three friends of
Shakespeare certainly facilitated the proceedings.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_10"><i>Mr. Theobald’s Parallels and Mr. Bayley’s Conclusions.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Mr. Theobald gets away from his biographical
pabulum and plunges into the literary arguments
for Bacon’s authorship of the plays, he has little that is
original to reveal, but much that is new in the way of
parallels and coincidences. In the first place, he takes it for
granted that Shakespeare could not, by any possibility, have
written the plays. He does not prove it, but&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cela va sans
dire</i>. Then he proceeds, to the extent of some four hundred
pages of matter, to demonstrate, by reference to the significant
Baconian characteristics in the plays, and the still
more significant parallels between the poetry of Shakespeare
and the philosophy of Bacon, that Bacon must be
the author of both. Bacon, for instance, appears to have
had a “very curious habit” of striking himself on the
breast when he wished to emphasise an argument. Brutus,
Ophelia, Clarence’s little boy, and Claudio, are all represented
as using a similar gesture. Some such lamentations
as Bacon may be supposed to have uttered after his
fall, are to be found in <i>King Lear</i>, and Lucrece’s self-condemnation
of herself to death for an offence of which
she is entirely innocent is, of course, inspired by Bacon’s
behaviour in making a full and humble submission to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Lords in respect of offences which he never committed.
The mere fact that <i>Lucrece</i> was published in 1594, and that
Bacon’s downfall did not take place until 1621, is a point
of no moment&mdash;we can readily agree with Mr. Theobald
that “there is a very curious reflection of Bacon’s character
and temperament in the poem of <i>Lucrece</i>.” Lucrece
absolves herself in the reflection,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The poison’d fountain clears itself again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why not I from this compelled stain?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Everybody knows that Bacon, “for some time after his
condemnation, expected to resume his ordinary functions
as counsellor to Parliament, and adviser to the King”&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ergo</i>
Lucrece was Bacon’s prototype&mdash;in petticoats. Moreover,
in the <i>Essays</i>, Bacon affixes to a meditative reflection
in one of his philosophical propositions the phrase, “I
cannot tell.” The same phrase, scarcely remarkable in
itself, occurs several times in the Plays. Mr. Theobald
devotes a whole chapter of his book to emphasising this
remarkable coincidence. He advances pages of historical
parallels, and he remarks, almost enthusiastically, that
both Shakespeare and Bacon have dilated with pitiless
logic on “the uselessness of hope.”</p>

<p class="smaller">From an original painting in the possession of
The Marquis of Salisbury.</p></div></div>

<p>But Mr. Theobald is most amusing when he compares
Bacon’s <i>Essay of Love</i> with the treatment of Love in
Shakespeare. We know Bacon’s opinion of love, as expressed
in the <i>Essay</i>, and we find it difficult to reconcile
it with the rhapsodies that we find in the Plays; we
remember <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and the exquisite comment,
“Imagine Juliet as the party, loved”&mdash;or, rather, we
should do so, if Mr. Theobald was not at our elbow to
explain the apparent contradiction in thought and term.
Love, it would appear, has two sides. There is the
“bosom” side, and the business side. Here we have a
full and convincing explanation of the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the views of love as expressed in the <i>Essay</i>, and the
Shakespearean application of the sentiment as displayed in
his dramas. In the Plays, Bacon regarded love from the
“bosom” point of view, while in the <i>Essay</i>, the “very
brief, very aphoristic, very concentrated, never discoursive
or rhetorical, but severely reflective and practical essay,”
he was dealing with Juliet as a “business” detail&mdash;a
contracting party, in short&mdash;“the party loved.” Nothing
could be more convincing! It would almost lead us to
entertain a greater admiration for Bacon than Spedding
could hope for. He has not only voiced two such entirely
contradictory views of love as we find in the <i>Essay</i> of
Bacon and the plays of Shakespeare, but he has, with the
aid of Mr. Theobald, showed that, “curiously enough,” the
two conflicting expressions are “significantly identical.”
There is surely no need to proceed further. Mr. Theobald
has proved his contention, and we must perforce accept
his conclusions that Shakespeare, the arch-impostor, the
champion literary fraud of all time, was “either entirely
uneducated, or very imperfectly educated; that his Latin
was small, his Greek less, and his pure English least of
all; that such handwriting as his could never have
figured on a University examination paper&mdash;this is the
opinion, it will be observed, of an M.A., and a former
editor of <i>The Bacon Journal</i>&mdash;that his whole life was too
full of business, too much devoted to money to leave any
extensive opportunities for study, or for large, broad,
world-covering experience.”</p>

<p>But if we make it a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine quâ non</i> that the writer of the
Plays was a man of leisure not devoted to mammon, “with
ample opportunity for study, and of a broad-world covering
experience” (whatever that may precisely mean), it is
proof positive that he was not the man whom we know
as Francis Bacon. Bacon’s whole life was devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
business, and to the getting of money; he had no leisure,
as he is for ever telling us, for his life’s work, and his
experience of the world of men was so superficial and
misleading that it sent Essex to the block, brought the
King to loggerheads with his Parliament, and encompassed
the utter downfall and disgrace of the cunning Chancellor.
We need not be flustered by Mr. Theobald’s hysterical
opinion that Shakespeare’s writing was “so execrably
bad, so unmistakably rustic and plebean, that one may
reasonably doubt whether his penmanship extended beyond
the capacity of signing his name to a business document,”
because we have Spedding’s statement that Shakespeare’s
signature is simply characteristic of the caligraphy of the
time, and we know by comparison that it is in advance,
both in style and legibility, of that of Sir Nicholas Bacon,
the father of the great Pretender.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Bayley, the author of <i>The Tragedy of Sir
Francis Bacon</i>, is, in the same degree, disdainful of facts.
He declares that he will quote verbatim from Mr. Sidney
Lee’s well-known <i>Life of Shakespeare</i> which would be most
commendable in him if he did it&mdash;but he doesn’t. Rather
he quotes the opinion of Richard Grant White, who says
that “Shakespeare was the son of a Warwickshire
peasant,” who “signed his name with a mark,” and that
the Poet was “apprenticed to a butcher.” It is but waste
of space to repeat that such assertions are palpably false. It
may be true, as Mr. Bayley states, that Stratford, in 1595,
was in an unsanitary condition, and that the Metropolitan
theatres were the resort of undesirable persons&mdash;even that
Shakespeare entered the play-house as a servitor, but all
this proves nothing. It is also true that, up to the time that
Shakespeare’s plays began to be produced, “there had been
nothing in his career that would cause us to suppose he was
a sublime genius,” but until Homer, or Michael Angelo, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Rudyard Kipling began to produce their masterpieces, we
knew of nothing in them to make us accept them as heaven-born
geniuses. Mr. Bayley assumes that Shakespeare left
Stratford-upon-Avon in 1585 with “<i>Venus and Adonis</i>,
<i>Lucrece</i>, and, perhaps, <i>Hamlet</i>, in his pocket.” The reason
for his assumption is not vouchsafed to us. True, our
dramatist left Stratford in 1585, but <i>Venus</i> was not published
until 1593, and it was not until 1602 that <i>Hamlet</i>
was produced. The mere fact that “in the sixteenth
century the provincial dialects were so marked that the
county gentry ... had difficulty in making themselves
understood, except to their provincial neighbours,” proves
that both these works were composed after Shakespeare
had been for some time a resident in London, and indeed
it is ridiculous to suppose that it took him eight years to
find a publisher for <i>Venus and Adonis</i>. Donnelly deciphered
the Bishop of Worcester’s opinion that Shakespeare was
“a butcher’s rude and vulgar apprentice,” who “in our
opinion was not likely to have writ them (the Plays).”
“In our opinion” is scarcely evidence. Mr. Bayley’s
contemptuous reference to Shakespeare’s handwriting as
“five strange scrawls,” is combated by Spedding’s
authoritative dictum, and his immediately succeeding
conclusion that the classical allusions and references in
the Plays prove the author to have been “a cultured
aristocrat,” robs his entire argument of sapiency or merit.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Bayley’s <i>The Tragedy of Francis Bacon</i>, is,
in my opinion, an inconsequential contribution to the
controversy. In the chapter on Papermarks, his contention
that every fresh device necessitates a new mould (p. 38) is
correct, but his deductions are senseless; the fact being
that the paper is contributed from very many&mdash;mostly
foreign&mdash;mills. Take one of Caxton’s books&mdash;say, <i>The
Golden Legend</i>&mdash;and you will find 50 different water-marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in one volume; if all the copies could be examined,
probably double or treble the number would be revealed.
One hasn’t the patience to follow Mr. Bayley’s “reasoning”:
he believes one of the paper-marks (No. 55) to be Rosicrucian&mdash;it
is the Divine monogram, and traceable to the
first century. No. 14, the “fool’s-cap,” gives the name to
a size of paper still extant&mdash;so of the vase, or “pott.”
The symbols are allusive, heraldic, or “canting,” mostly
emblematic, or in rebus form. That is all. What more
natural for the paper-maker <i>Lile</i> than to take the Fleur-de-lys
for his trade symbol? With respect to printers’ headlines,
tail-pieces, etc., they were (and are) simply fancy
types used for decorative purposes. The oak, and its fruit
the acorn&mdash;the rose, Tudor or otherwise, the lily, typifying
our conquest of France, only erased from the Royal Arms
<i>temp.</i> George III., would all, from a national standpoint,
become the commonest form of ornament, and each, in its
turn, lend itself to the fancy of the designer, who, Mr.
Bayley would have us think, were all under the direction
of Francis Bacon, who wove a wonderful story by this
puerile means. As for the printers’ “hieroglyphics,” as
Mr. Bayley calls them, they have been used almost from
the invention of the art to the present time. Amongst
publishers, too, they are common. The printer of <i>The
Tragedy of Sir Francis Bacon</i> employs one: a lion supporting
the trade symbol of Aldus. I have not consulted Mr.
Whittingham, but (if he knows anything at all about it)
he would probably say the device signifies that he is the
English successor of the Venetian printer!</p>

<div id="ip_60" class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
  <img src="images/i_097.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="" /></div>

<p>So far as Shakespeare’s handwriting is concerned, I do
not propose at the present moment to go beyond the
opinion of Spedding. It would profit nothing to enter
into a discussion on the subject until one has something
tangible in the way of evidence to offer. Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Will, for instance, has always been regarded as a witness
for the Baconian case, but if the result of the investigations
I am prosecuting confirm my suspicions, it will
become a piece of important evidence for Shakespeare.
The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bona-fides</i> of this Will have always appeared to be
more than questionable, and I am hopeful of being in a
position shortly to connect it with the great fraud which I
am satisfied has been perpetrated by Bacon.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_11"><i>The Bi-Literal Cipher.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> most interesting feature of the Bacon-Shakespeare
controversy at the present moment is the alleged discovery
by Mrs. Elizabeth Wells Gallup, of Detroit, U.S.A., of
a bi-literal cipher by Bacon, which appears in no fewer than
forty-five books, published between 1591 and 1628. Mrs.
Gallup was assisting Dr. Orville W. Owen (also of Detroit,
U.S.A.), in the preparation of the later books of his <i>Sir
Francis Bacon’s Cipher Story</i>, and in the study of the
“great word cipher,” discovered by Dr. Owen, when she
became convinced that the very full explanation found in
<i>De Augmentis Scientiarum</i> of the bi-literal method of
cipher-writing, was something more than a mere treatise
on the subject. She applied the rules given to the
peculiarly italicised words, and “letters in two forms,” as
they appear in the photographic facsimile of the 1623 folio
edition of the Shakespeare plays. The surprising disclosures
that resulted from the experiment, sent her to the
original editions of Bacon’s known works, and from those
to all the authors whose books Bacon claimed as his own.
The bi-literal cipher, according to Mrs. Gallup, held true in
every instance, and she is fully entitled to have her
discovery thoroughly investigated before it is condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
as a “pure invention.” Mrs. Gallup solemnly declares her
translation to be “absolutely veracious,” and until it is
authoritatively declared that the bi-literal cipher does not
exist in the works in which she professes to have traced it,
I am not prepared to question her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonâ fides</i>. Her conclusions
are absurd, but her premises may be proved to be
impregnable. She is convinced of the soundness of her
discoveries, and she forthwith leaps to the conclusion that
“the proofs are overwhelming and irresistible, that Bacon
was the author of the delightful lines attributed to Spenser&mdash;the
fantastic conceits of Peele and Greene&mdash;the historical
romances of Marlowe&mdash;the immortal plays and poems put
forth in Shakespeare’s name&mdash;as well as the <i>Anatomy of
Melancholy</i> of Burton.” Mrs. Gallup shows scant appreciation
of the illimitable genius she claims for Bacon in
this sentence.</p>

<p>The inaccurately described bi-literal cipher, which
Bacon, who claims to have invented it, explained with
great elaboration in his <i>De Augmentis Scientiarum</i>, has
nothing whatever to do with the composition or the
wording of the works in which it is said to exist. It
depends not on the author, but on the printer. It is
altogether a matter of typography. One condition alone
is necessary&mdash;control over the printing, so as to ensure its
being done from specially marked manuscripts, or altered
in proof. It shall, as Bacon says, be performed thus:&mdash;“First
let all the letters of the alphabet, by transposition,
be resolved into two letters only&mdash;hence bi-literal&mdash;for the
transposition of two letters by five placings will be sufficient
for 32 differences, much more than 24, which is the number
of the alphabet. The example of such an alphabet is on
this <span class="locked">wise:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">For the purpose of introducing this alphabet into the book

taken to stand for “a’s” and others for “b’s.” In Bacon’s

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Bacon had a three-fold motive for putting his cipher
into every book of merit that was published in his day. In
the first place, it allowed him to claim the authorship of
the book. In the second, in Mrs. Gallup’s own words, “it
was the means of conveying to a future time the truth
which was being concealed from the world concerning
himself&mdash;his right to be King of England&mdash;secrets of State
regarding Queen Elizabeth&mdash;his mother&mdash;and other prominent
characters of that day&mdash;the correction of English
history in important particulars, the exposure of the wrongs
that had been put upon him;” and, equally important,
thirdly, of publishing his version of the wrongs he had
done to others, and to Essex in particular. Concerning the
amazing diversity of style displayed in the many works, he
says in his cipher: “I varied my stile to suit men, since no
two shew the same taste and like imagination....”
“When I have assum’d men’s names, th’ next step is to
create for each a stile naturall to the man that yet should
let my owne bee seene, as a thrid of warpe in my entire
fabricke.” His explanation of the diversity of merit that
is displayed in the works of Robert Greene and of Shakespeare,
is not less interesting and instructive. “It shall bee
noted in truth that some (plays) greatly exceede their
fellowes in worth, and it is easily explained. Th’ theame
varied, yet was alwayes a subject well selected to convey
the secret message. Also the plays being given out as
tho’gh written by the actor, to whom each had bin
consign’d, turne one’s genius suddainlie many times to
suit th’ new man.”</p>

<p>“In this actour that wee now emploie (the cipher
appears in the 1611 quarto edition of <i>Hamlet</i>), is a wittie
veyne different from any formerly employ’d. [Bacon
appears to have forgotten that he employed the ‘masque’
of Shakespeare in the quarto editions of <i>Richard II.</i> (1598),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
<i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i> (1600), and of <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Henry V.</i>
(1608), and <i>Pericles</i> (1609)]. In truth it suiteth well with a
native spirrit, humourous and grave by turnes in ourself.
Therefore, when wee create a part that hath him in minde,
th’ play is correspondingly better therefor.”</p>

<p>In the cipher story which is found by Mrs. Gallup in
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, Bacon again recurs to the superior
merit of the plays put forth in Shakespeare’s name, and he
extols the merits of Shakespeare as an interpreter of these
<span class="locked">dramas:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We can win bayes, lawrell gyrlo’ds and renowne, and
we can raise a shining monumente which shale not suffer
the hardly wonne, supremest, crowning glory to fade.
Nere shal the lofty and wide-reaching honor that such
workes as these bro’t us bee lost whilst there may even a
work bee found to afforde opportunity to actors&mdash;who may
play those powerful parts which are now soe greeted with
great acclayme&mdash;to winne such names and honours as Wil
Shakespear, o’ The Glob’ so well did win, acting our dramas.</p>

<p>“That honour must to earth’s final morn yet follow
him, but al fame won from th’ authorshippe (supposed) of
our plays must in good time&mdash;after our owne worke,
putting away its vayling disguises, standeth forth as you
(the decipherer) only know it&mdash;bee yeelded to us.”</p>

<p>If Mr. Mallock reposes any confidence in his Bacon&mdash;according
to Mrs. Gallup&mdash;he must at once withdraw his
description of Shakespeare as a “notoriously ill-educated
actor.” Bacon himself, in the foregoing, acknowledges
that Will Shakespeare derived a well-won reputation and
honours by acting in his dramas. At the same time Bacon
is confident that the dramas will win for him, as author,
“supremest, crowning, and unfading glory.”</p>

<p>Here, almost at the outset of these cipher revelations, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
are met by a passage, plausible in itself, but which, read
in the light of our knowledge of Bacon’s doubts upon
the permanency of the English language, calls for careful
consideration. Bacon rested his fame upon his Latin
writings. He wrote always for the appreciation of posterity.
As he advanced in years, he appears, says Abbott, to have
been more and more impressed with the hopelessness of
any expectations of lasting fame or usefulness based upon
English books. He believed implicitly that posterity would
not preserve works written in the modern languages&mdash;“for
these modern languages will at one time or other
play the bank-rowtes (bankrupts) with books.” Of his
Latin translation of the <i>Advancement of Learning</i>, he said,
“It is a book I think will live, and be a citizen of the
world, as English books will not,” and he predicted that
the Latin volume of his <i>Essays</i> would “last as long as books
shall last.” So confident was he that his writings would
achieve immortality, that he dedicated his <i>Advancement of
Learning</i> to the King, in order that the virtues and mental
qualities of his Majesty might be handed down to succeeding
ages in “some solid work, fixed memorial, and immortal
monument.” Bacon’s pride in his work was monumental,
his “grasp on futurity” was conceived in a spirit of
“magnificent audacity;” every scrap of his writings was
jealously preserved and robed in the time-resisting garments
of a dead language. Is it conceivable in this magnificent
egoist that he should have displayed such gross carelessness,
such wanton unconcern in his plays that, but for the
labours of a couple of actors in collecting and arranging
them, they would have been utterly lost? It is simply
incredible that Bacon should have based his anticipation of
immortality upon plays which for years were tossed about
the world in pirated and mutilated editions, and in many
instances, until the issue of the first folio in 1623, existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
only in the form of the actor’s prompt books. The sixteen
plays, in quarto, which were in print in 1616, were
published without the co-operation of the author. They
were to win for their author unfading glory, yet he was at
no pains to collect them. The first folio was printed from
the acting versions in use by the company with which
Shakespeare had been associated, and the editorial duties
were undertaken by two of Shakespeare’s friends and
fellow actors, whose motives rather than their literary
fitness for the task call for commendation. It was dedicated
to two noblemen, with whom, so far as we know, Bacon
had no social or political intercourse.</p>

<div id="ip_69" class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
  <img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="" /></div>

<p>Mr. Theobald considers that Bacon’s “confident
assurance of holding a lasting place in literature,” his
anticipation of immortality, could only have been advanced
by the man who voiced the same conviction in the Shakespeare
<i>Sonnets</i>. The deduction is based on arbitrary
conjecture, and a limited acquaintance with the literary
conceits of the time. But Shakespeare claimed as his
medium of immortality the language which Bacon predicted
could not endure.</p>

<span class="i0">So long lives this, and this gives life to Thee,”<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="in0">wrote Shakespeare. This was English, the purest and the
sweetest that tongue ever uttered, and Bacon was dressing
his thoughts in Latin that they might outlive the language
which Shakespeare wrote. Ronsard and Desportes, in
France, and in England, Drayton, Daniel, and, indeed, all
the Elizabethan poets, had made the topic a commonplace.
In his <i>Apologie for Poetrie</i>, Sir Philip Sidney wrote that it
was the custom of poets “to tell you that they will make
you immortal by their verses,” and both Shakespeare and
Bacon adopted the current conceit when they referred to
the “eternising” faculty of their literary effusions. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
is not claimed by, or for, Bacon that he was the author of
Drayton’s <i>Idea</i> or Daniel’s <i>Delia</i>, but if Mr. Theobald’s
style of reasoning is to be taken at his own valuation, the
master of Gorhambury, and none other, was responsible
for the poetic output of both these singers.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_12"><i>Bacon’s “Sterne and Tragicle History.”</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> are assured by another Baconian student that the
Shakespeare plays were not an end, but merely a
means to an end, the end being the revelation of Bacon’s
history, and the composition of further plays and poems
from the material which he had warehoused in the dramas
attributed to Shakespeare and other authors. The initial,
and most important fact which Mrs. Gallup’s deciphered
story reveals, is, not that Francis Bacon was the author
of Shakespeare’s plays, but that he was the legitimate son
of Queen Elizabeth, by Robert Dudley, afterwards Earl
of Leicester. The disclosure is so startling, so quaint, so
incredible, and withal so interesting, that the revelation
both appeals to and outrages our credulity. From our
knowledge of Elizabeth and of Bacon, we can more readily
believe that the Queen was the mother of Bacon, than
that Bacon was the father of Shakespeare’s plays. At
Gorhambury is to be seen a pair of oil paintings, by
Hilliard, of Elizabeth and Leicester. The pictures are a
match in size, style, and treatment. The doublet in which
Leicester is portrayed is of the same material as that of
the gown in which the Queen is represented. Moreover,
they were a present from Elizabeth to Sir Nicholas Bacon,
the foster father of Francis, who signs his cipher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
revelations, “Francis First of England,” “Francis Bacon
(Rightful) R,” “F.B. or T.” or “Francis of E.”, as the
humour seized him.</p>

<p>The deciphered secret story, the “sterne and tragicle”
history of Bacon’s political wrongs commences in the first
edition of Edmund Spenser’s <i>Complaints</i> (1590 and 1591);
but it was not until the <i>Faerie Queene</i> was published (1596)
that he appropriates the authorship of Spenser’s works.
His first care is to establish his claim to the throne:</p>

<p>“Our name is Fr. Bacon, by adoption, yet it shall be
different. Being of blood roial (for the Queen, our
sov’raigne, who married by a private rite the Earle
Leicester&mdash;and at a subseque’t time, also, as to make
surer thereby, without pompe, but i’ th’ presence o’ a
suitable number of witnesses, bound herselfe by those
hymeneall bands againe&mdash;is our mother, and wee were not
base-born, or base-begot), we be Tudor, and our stile shall
be Francis First, in all proper cours of time, th’ King of
our realme.</p>

<p>“Early in our life, othe (oath)&mdash;or threat as binding in
effect as othe, we greatly doubt&mdash;was made by our wilful
parent concerning succession, and if this cannot bee
chang’d, or be not in time withdrawn, we know not how
the kingdome shall be obtain’d. But ’tis thus seene or
shewn that it can bee noe other’s by true desce’t, then is
set down. To Francis First doth th’ crowne, th’ honor
of our land belong....”</p>

  <div class="caption">GORHAMBURY, A.D. 1821.</div></div>

<p>Thus Bacon states his case, and through the succeeding
368 pages of Mrs. Gallup’s book he repeats the assertion <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad
nauseam</i>. He makes no attempt to prove his claim&mdash;he
early allows it to be understood that he is unable to
verify his asseverations, nor does he explain how or why
his name should be Tuder, or Tidder. As the son of Lord
Robert Dudley, he would be a Dudley. The circumstantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
evidence with which he supports his case is interesting, but
valueless; his conclusions are unproven, his facts are something
more than shaky. But let us pursue the story:</p>

<p>“We, by men call’d Bacon, are sonne of the Sov’raigne,
Queene Elizabeth, who confin’d i’ th’ Tow’r, married Ro. D.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth, it appears, was once “so mad daring” as
to dub Bacon, “as a sonne of Follie,” to “th’ courageous
men of our broadland.” <span class="locked">But&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“No man hath claime to such pow’r as some shal se in
mighty England, after th’ decease of Virgin Queene
E&mdash;&mdash; by dull, slow mortalls, farre or near, loved, wooed
like some gen’rously affected youth-loving mayden, whylst
she is both wife to th’ noble lord that was so sodainly cut
off in his full tide and vigour of life and mothe’&mdash;in such
way as th’ women of the world have groaninglie bro’t
foorth, and must whilst Nature doth raigne&mdash;of two
noble sonnes, Earle of Essex, trained up by Devereux,
and he who doth speake to you, th’ foster sonne of two
wel fam’d frie’ds o’ th’ Que., Sir Nichola’ Bacon, her
wo’thie adviser and counsellor, and that partne’ of loving
labor and dutie, my most loved Lady Anne Bacon....”</p>

<p>“... My mother Elizabeth ... join’d herselfe in
a union with Robert Dudley whilst th’ oath sworne to one
as belov’d yet bound him. I have bene told hee aided in
th’ removall of this obstructio’, when turni’g on that
narrowe treach’rous step, as is naturall, shee lightly leaned
upon th’ raile, fell on th’ bricks&mdash;th’ paving of a court&mdash;and
so died.”</p>

<p>“In such a sonne,” Bacon proceeds, “th’ wisest our
age thus farr hath shewen&mdash;pardon, prithee, so u’seemly a
phrase, I must speake it heere&mdash;th’ mother should lose
selfish vanitie, and be actuated only by a desire for his
advancement.”</p>

<p>Bacon is confident that the Queen would have acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
his claims but for the advice of a “fox seen at our
court in th’ form and outward appearance of a man named
Robbert Cecill, the hunchback,” who poisoned Elizabeth’s
mind against her “sonne of Follie.” Both “Francis
Tudor” (or Tidder), and his brother Essex, the “wrong’d
enfan’s of a Queene,” learned that their “royall aspirations”
were to receive “a dampening, a checke soe great, it
co’vinc’d both, wee were hoping for advanceme’t we might
never attaine.”</p>

<p>The “royall aspirations” of the Earl of Essex were
cut short by the sentence of death that was passed upon
him by “that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mère</i> and my owne counsel. Yet this truth
must at some time be knowne; had not I allow’d myselfe
to give some countenance to th’ arraingement, a subsequent
triall, as wel as th’ sentence, I must have lost th’ life that
I held so pricelesse.” And Bacon, or Francis Tidder,
solaces himself, and condones his part in the deed with the
reflection that, “Life to a schola’ is but a pawne for
mankind.”</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth, Bacon tells us, though already
wedded “secretly to th’ Earle, my father, at th’ Tower of
London, was afterwards married at the house of Lord
P&mdash;&mdash;....”</p>

<p>Briefly, then, we have it, on the authority of the cipher
translation, that “Bacon was the son of Elizabeth and
Robert Dudley, who were married in the Tower between
1554 and 1558. Leicester’s wife did not meet with her
fatal accident until 1560. Bacon was born in January,
1561. His parents were subsequently re-married, at a date
not stated, at the house of Lord P&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>In 1611 (<i>Shepheard’s Calendar</i>) Bacon declares “Ended
is now my great desire to sit in British throne. Larger
worke doth invite my hand than majestie doth offer;
to wield th’ penne dothe ever require a greater minde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
then to sway the royall scepter. Ay, I cry to th’
Heavenly Ayde, ruling ore all, ever to keepe my soule thus
humbled and contente.” But in 1613 (<i>Faerie Queene</i>),
he says, that “in th’ secrecy o’ my owne bosome, I do
still hold to th’ faith that my heart has never wholly
surrendered, that truth shall come out of error, and
my head be crowned ere my line o’ life be sever’d. How
many times this bright dreeme hath found lodgement in
my braine!... It were impossible, I am assurr’d,
since witnesses to th’ marriage, and to my birth (after a
proper length of time) are dead, and the papers certifying
their presence being destroyed, yet is it a wrong that will
rise, and crye that none can hush.” In 1620 (<i>Novum
Organum</i>) he has lost his “feare, lest my secret bee s’ented
forth by some hound o’ Queen Elizabeth;” but “the
jealousy of the King is to be feared, and that more in
dread of effecte on the hearts of the people, then any feare
of th’ presentation of my claime, knowing as he doth,
that all witnesses are dead, and the requir’d documents
destroy’d.”</p>

<p>Bacon, according to the cipher, was sixteen years of age
when he learned the truth of his parentage through the
indiscretion of one “th’ ladies o’ her (the Queen’s) train,
who foolish to rashnesse did babble such gossip to him as
she heard at the Court.” Bacon, it seems, taxed the Queen
forthwith with her motherhood of him, and Elizabeth, with
“much malicious hatred” and “in hastie indignation,” said:</p>

<p>“You are my own borne sonne, but you, though truly
royall, of a fresh, a masterlie spirit, shall rule not England,
or your mother, nor reigne on subjects yet t’ bee. I bar
from succession forevermore my best beloved first borne
that bless’d my unio’ with&mdash;no, I’ll not name him, nor
need I yet disclose the sweete story conceal’d thus farre so
well, men only guesse it, nor know o’ a truth o’ th’ secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
marriages, as rightfull to guard the name o’ a Queene, as
of a maid o’ this realm. It would well beseeme you to
make such tales sulk out of sight, but this suiteth not t’
your kin’ly spirit. A sonne like mine lifteth hand nere in
aide to her who brought him foorth; hee’d rather uplift
craven maides who tattle thus whenere my face (aigre enow
ev’r, they say) turneth from them. What will this brave
boy do? Tell a, b, c’s?”</p>

<p>“Weeping and sobbing sore,” Bacon hurries to Mistres
Bacon’s chamber and entreats her to assure him that he is
“the sonne of herselfe and her honored husband....
When, therefore, my sweet mother did, weeping and
lamenting, owne to me that I was in very truth th’ sonne o’
th’ Queene, I burst into maledictio’s ’gainst th’ Queene,
my fate, life, and all it yieldeth.... I besought her to
speak my father’s name.... She said, ‘He is the Earle
of Leicester.... I tooke a solemne oath not to reveale
your storie to you, but you may hear my unfinish’d tale to
th’ end and if you will, go to th’ midwife. Th’ doctor would
be ready also to give proofes of your just right to be named
th’ Prince of this realm, and heire-apparent to the throne.
Nevertheless, Queen Bess did likewise give her solemn oath
of bald-faced deniall of her marriage to Lord Leicester, as
well as to her motherhood. Her oath, so broken, robs me
of a sonne. O Francis, Francis, breake not your mother’s
hearte. I cannot let you go forth after all the years you
have beene the sonne o’ my heart. But night is falling.
To-day I cannot speak to you of so weighty a matter.
This hath mov’d you deeply, and though you now drie
your eyes, you have yet many teare marks upon your little
cheeks. Go now; do not give it place i’ thought or word;
a brain-sick woman, though she be a Queene, can take my
sonne from me.’” So Bacon leaves her, not to search for
the midwife, or cross-question the doctor, but to “dreame of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
golden scepters, prou’ courts, and by-and-bye a crowne on
mine innocent brow.”</p>

<p>All Bacon’s confessions, if true, prove him to have been
a bastard, but this logical and inevitable conclusion he
repeatedly denies. He claims his mother’s name, and for
his father, a nobleman whose wife was living at the time
of his bigamous marriage with Elizabeth. If the marriage
was valid, why were Leicester and the Queen re-married at
the house of Lord P., and in what year did the second
ceremony take place? But although anti-Baconians maintain
that Bacon was not a fool, and therefore could not
have seriously advanced such claims; that if he had done
so he would have made a more plausible story of his wrongs;
that he was not a dunce, and therefore could not have
written the “maudlin and illiterate drivel” attributed to
him by Mrs. Gallup, it is still inconceivable that this cipher
story is a gigantic fraud. Mr. Andrew Lang, who makes
no doubt that Mrs. Gallup has honourably carried out her
immense task of deciphering, has arrived at the conclusion
that Bacon was obviously mad.</p>

<h2 id="ch_13"><i>Bacon, the Author of all Elizabethan-Jacobean Literature.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">But</span> interesting as it is to find in Bacon yet another and
hitherto an unsuspected pretender to the throne of
England, his pretensions to the authorship of Shakespeare’s
plays is a feature of even more dazzling interest. His
reasons for denying the authorship while he lived have
hitherto demanded a great deal of speculative explanation.
The general theory of the Baconites is that Bacon concealed
his authorship of the plays because such writing
was held in low esteem, or as Mr. Sinnett puts it, Bacon
“shrank from compromising his social reputation by any
open connection with the despised vocation of the playwright.”
The difficulty of accepting this assumption has
hitherto been found in the fact that there was no reason
why Bacon should have confined himself to the writing
of plays. In the case of Shakespeare, it was quite
understandable, for he was an actor, and the stage was
his livelihood. Bacon, on the other hand, had no love
for the theatre; he looked upon play-acting as a toy, and
masques as things unworthy of serious observations. The
tone of his comments is contemptuous, and his criticism
discloses a lack of knowledge and interest in the subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Why should this man, who regarded the stage with ill-concealed
repugnance, have written plays which he was
ashamed to own, while all imaginative literature was open
to him. The stigma which it is erroneously alleged was
attached to play-writing was not associated with poetry;
if the playwright was under a ban, the poet was on the
pedestal. There must have been a more tangible reason
for Bacon’s concealment, but we have had to wait for
Mrs. Gallup’s book to disclose it. Bacon’s object in writing
was to unfold the secrets of his birth and to ventilate his
wrongs; he chose plays as his medium because, like Mr.
George Bernard Shaw, he found blank verse easier to
write than prose. He employed the pseudonyms of
Greene and Peele, and the pen name of Marlowe ere taking
that of Wm. Shakespeare as his masque or vizard, “that
we should remayne unknowne, inasmuch as wee, having
worked in drama, history that is most vig’rously supprest,
have put ourselfe soe greatly in dange’ that a word unto
Queene Elizabeth, without doubt, would give us a sodaine
horriblle end&mdash;an exit without re-entrance&mdash;for in truth
she is authoress and preserve’ of this, our being.”</p>

<p>Bacon’s first claim to authorship, apart from the works
which were issued under his own name, is to be found,
according to the cipher, in the 1596 edition of the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>:</p>

<p>“E. Sp. could not otherwise so easilie atchieve honours
that pertyne to ourself. Indeed, this would alone crowne
his head, if this were all&mdash;I speake not of golden crowne,
but of lawrell&mdash;for our pen is dipt deepe into th’ muses’
pure source.”</p>

<p>The first mention of Shakespeare as Bacon’s masque
appears in the J. Roberts’ edition (1600) of <i>Sir John Oldcastle</i>
and <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>:</p>

<p>“See or read. In the stage-plaies, two, the oldest or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
earliest devices prove these twentie plays to have been put
upon our stage by the actor that is suppos’d to sell dramas
of value, yet ’tis rightlie mine owne labour.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Advancement of Learning</i> (1605) Bacon extends
his claim to embrace the works of Robert Greene, Peele,
Marlowe, and Ben Jonson:</p>

<p>“My stage plaies have all been disguis’d (to wit, many
in Greene’s name, or in Peele’s, Marlowe’s, a fewe, such as
the Queen’s Masques and others of this kind published for
me by Jonson, my friend and co-worker) since I relate a
secret history therein, a story of so sterne and tragick
qualite, it ille suited my lighte’ verse, in the earlier works.”</p>

<p>The only other persons who are permitted the privilege
of communicating with posterity, through the medium of
the cipher, are Bacon’s “friends and co-workers,” Ben
Jonson and William Rawley. In the folio edition of
Jonson’s plays (1616) at Bacon’s “constantly urged
request,” Jonson, who had his friend’s “fame in heart as
much as my honour and dignitie,” writes to the decipherer:</p>

<p>“It shall be noted, indeed, when you uncover his stile,
my works do not all come from mine owne penne, for I
shall name to you some plays that come forth fro’ Sir F.
Bacon, his worthy hand or head, I bein’ but the masque
behind which he was surely hid. Th’ play entitled
<i>Sejanus</i> was his drama, and th’ King’s, Queen’s, Prince’s
Entertainments; the <i>Queen’s Masques</i> are his, as also th’
short <i>Panegyre</i>.”</p>

<p>But we learn that, in addition to Jonson, “my foster-brother
Anthony, my owne brother Robert, Ben Jonson,
my friend, adviser and assistant, and our private secretary,”
were also “cogniza’t of the work,” and indeed after Bacon’s
death in 1626, William Rawley, his private secretary, took
up the cipher story, and completed it in Burton’s <i>Anatomy
of Melancholy</i>, and in the 1635 editions of <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and the <i>New Atlantis</i>. It has been objected that Bacon
could not have dropped the cipher into books published
after his death, but this objection “vanishes into invisibility,”
as Mr. Theobald would say, when we remember
that faithful old Rawley was living long after Bacon’s work
had been “cut short by th’ sickel o’ death.” He bobs up
serenely in <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i>, drops in another thirty pages
of Bacon’s cipher lamentations, and winds up with a dozen
lines of his own “to speak of th’ errata.” This last
instalment was, it may be assumed, written prior to
1626, and entrusted to Rawley to make use of on the first
opportunity, <i>i.e.</i>, as soon as he could obtain command of
the proofs of another book.</p>

<p>In the first folio, published twenty years after the death
of Elizabeth, Bacon still appears to be affrighted by the
memory of the Queen; his life would still be forfeit if
his identity were discovered, “since she is my mother;”
but in his valedictory address to his decipherer, he declares
that it is “not feare, but disstaste of th’ unseemly talk and
much curiosity of the many who read these cipher histories,
that makes him still desirous to preserving his incognito.”</p>

<p>“My time of feare went from me with my greatness,
but I still wish to avoid many questionings&mdash;and much
suspicion, perchance on the side of the King, in his owne
prope’ person. I have neede of the very caution which
kept these secrets from the many, when my mother made
me swear secrecy, and my life was the forfeit; nor may I
now speake openly, yet many men for a kingdom would
break their oathes.”</p>

<p>It is possible that Bacon may have considered that
“since witnesses to th’ marriage and to my birth ... are
dead, and the papers certifying their presence” were
destroyed, he would have a better chance of obtaining
credence for his story a few centuries hence than in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
own day. His belief in the credulity of posterity did not
desert him:</p>

<p>“But my kingdome is in immortall glory among men
from generatio’ unto coming generations. An unending
fame will crowne my browe, and it is farre better worthe
in any true thinking mind, I am assured, than many a
crowne which kings do have set on with shewe and
ceremonie. Yet when I have said it, my heart is sad for
the great wrong that I must for ever endure.”</p>

<p>Bacon appears to have foreseen that some future sceptic
would question the justice of his claims; would ask, for
instance, how the hand that wrote <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>The
Tempest</i>, came to produce such comparatively indifferent
stuff as <i>A Quip for an Upstart Courtier</i>, and he meets the
anticipated question with the following <span class="locked">explanation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It shall bee noted in truth that some greatly exceede
their fellowes in worth, and it is easily explained. Th’
theame varied, yet was always a subject well selected to
convey the secret message. Also the plays being given out
as tho’gh written by the actor to whom each had been
consigned, turne one’s genius suddainlie many times to
suit th’ new man.</p>

<p>“In this actour that wee now emploie, is a wittie vayne
different from any formerly employed. In truth it suiteth
well with a native spirrit, humorous and grave by turnes
in ourselfe. Therefore when we create a part that hath
him in minde th’ play is correspondingly better therefor. It
must be evident ... that these later dramas (this cipher
message is in the 1611 quarto of <i>Hamlet</i>) are superior in
nearlie all those scenes where our genius hath swaie”....</p>

<p>Over and over again, with almost childish iteration, the
cipher repeats the names of the authors whose works he
claims as his own:</p>

<p>“Spenser, Greene, Peele, Marlowe have sold me theirs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
(their names)&mdash;two or three others I have assumed upon
certaine occasions such as this (Ben Jonson’s <i>Masques</i>),
besides th’ one I beare among men.”...</p>

<p>“My plaies are not yet finisht, but I intend to put
forth severall soone. However, bi-literall work requiring
so much time, it will readily be seene that there is much to
doe aftee a booke doth seeme to be ready for the presse,
and I could not say when other plays will come out. The
next volume will be under W. Shakespeare’s name. As
some which have now beene produced have borne upon the
title page his name though all are my owne work, I have
allow’d it to stand on manie others which I myselfe regard
as equall in merite.”</p>

<p>“My next work is not begun here: much of it shall bee
found in th’ playes o’ Shakespeare which have not yet
come out. We having put forth a numbe’ of plays i’ his
theatre, shall continue soe doing since we doe make him
th’ thrall to our will. Our name never accompanieth anie
play, but it frequently appeareth plainly in cipher for witty
minds to transla’e from Latine and Greeke....”</p>

<p>“This history (<i>The Tragical Historie of the Earl of
Essex</i>) is contained (<i>i.e.</i>, hidden in cipher) in some stage
plays that came out in Shakespeare’s name. Ere long
there will be many of like stile, purpose and scope added
thereto, which shall both ayd and instruct you in th’ work.
This should make it cleare, <i>e.g.</i>, sixty stage-plays which, in
varyi’g stiles that are contrary to my owne well-known stile
of expression, whylst for more of our lighter work an
impenetrable mask, for a history, much too varied: hence
these great plays have been devis’d which, being similar,
often held this inne’ history therein unsuspected....”</p>

<p>“Several comedies, which be now strangers, as might
be said, bearing at th’ most such titles ’mongst the plaiers
as they would remember, but th’ author’s name in disguise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
if it bee seen at all, will, as soone as may be found toward
and propitious, be publisht by Shakespeare, <i>i.e.</i>, in his
name, having masqued thus manie of the best plaies that
we have beene able to produce. To these we are steadily
making additions, writing from two to six stage plays every
year....”</p>

<p>“All that learne that I, who accompte th’ truth better
than wicked vanitie, publish’d manie late playes under
other cognomen will think the motive some distaste of the
stage. In noe respect is it true....” His real reason
is, firstly, that “all men who write stage-playes are held
in co’tempte,” and, secondly, the plays are employed
to “send out much hidden dang’rous matter.” “In my
plays matters are chosen not alone for value as a subject
to heare and no longer heed. Each play is the meane or
th’ medium, by which cipher histories are sent forth.”</p>

<p>“Severall small works under no name wonne worthy
praise; next in Spenser’s name, also, they ventured into an
unknowne world. When I, at length, having written in
diverse stiles, found three who, for sufficient reward in
gold added to an immediate renowne as good pens,
willingly put forth all workes which I had compos’d I was
bolder....”</p>

<p>“Th’ evidence such plays give of being from the brayne
of one who hath for manie years made himself acquainted
with th’ formes and th’ methode&mdash;or art&mdash;of this dramatick
or representative poetry, maketh also my claime to other
workes, which have beene publisht in various names,
undeniable. The worke, despight a variety of styles, is
mine owne....”</p>

<p>“So few (plays) can bee put forth as first written
without a slighte revision, and many new being also made

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
“... small portions (of the cipher story) being used at

Jonson’s, affording our diverse masques another colour,
as ’twere, to baffle all seekers, to which we shall add
Burton’s....”</p>

<p>“Th’ worke beareth the title of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>,
and will bee put forth by Burton.”</p>

<p>Here is Bacon’s announcement of the publication of the
First Folio:</p>

<p>“In our plaies ... being in the name of a man not
living, there is still more of this secret historie.... We
have not lost that maske tho’ our Shakespeare no longer
liveth, since twoo others, fellowes of our play actor&mdash;who
would, we doubt not, publish those plays&mdash;would disguise
our work as well....”</p>

<p>“Our plaies are of diverse kindes&mdash;historie, comedie,
and tragedie. Many are upon th’ stage, but those already
put forth in Wm. Shakespeare’s name, we doe nothing
doubt, have won a lasting fame,&mdash;comedy, th’ historick
drama and tragedy, are alike in favour....”</p>

<p>“My best playes, at present, as William Shakespeare’s
work fost’red, will as soone as one more plaie be completed,
weare a fine but yet a quiet dresse, as is seemely in
plaies of as much valew and dignity as sheweth cleerly
therein, and be put foorth in folio enlarged and multiplyed
as th’ history conceal’d within th’ comedies, histories, or
tragedies required.”</p>

<p>Then follows a number of further recapitulations of his
masques:</p>

<p>“Francis of Verulam is author of all the plays heretofore
published by Marlowe, Greene, Peele, Shakespeare,
and of the two-and-twenty now put out for the first time.
Some are altered to continue his history....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
“Next write a comedy, a quaint device for making
knowne th’ men that do give, lend, sell, or in anie othe’
waye, have put me into possession of their names. These
I have us’d as disguises that my name might not bee seen
attached to any poem, stage-play, or anie of th’ light
workes o’ this day....”</p>

<p>“As I have often said ... you have poems and prose
workes on divers theames in all such various stiles, as are
put before th’ world as Greene’s, as Shakespeare’s, Burto’s,
as Peele’s, Spenser’s, as Marlowe’s, as Jonso’ dramas ...
for I varied my stile to suit different men, since no two
shew th’ same taste and like imagination....”</p>

<p>“Any play publisht as Marlowe’s, came from th’ same
source as all which you will now work out....”</p>

<p>“Greene, Spense’, Peele, Shakespeare, Burton, and
Marley, as you may somewhere see it, or, as it is usually
given, Marlowe, have thus farre been my masques....”</p>

<p>“A few workes also beare th’ name o’ my friend, Ben
Jonson&mdash;these are <i>Sejanus</i> and th’ <i>Masques</i>, used to
conceale the Iliads chiefly and to make use o’ my newe
cipher....”</p>

<p>“I masqued manie grave secrets in my poems which I
have publisht, now as Peele’s or Spenser’s, now as my
owne, then againe in th’ name of authours, so cald, who
plac’d workes of mixt sort before a reading world, prose
and poetry. To Robt. Greene did I entruste most of that
work....”</p>

<p>Bacon has limited our speculations upon the extent of
his literary work by definitely mentioning the works which
he wrote in a cipher discovered by Dr. Owen:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_14"><i>Bacon and “Divine Aide.”</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Bacon</span> himself appears to have been struck with the
immensity of his production, and he cast about for
some plausible explanation that would justify it in the eyes
of his twentieth century admirers. Human endurance and
fecundity would, he foresaw, be regarded as unequal to the
strain&mdash;Divine assistance alone could make so colossal a
task possible:</p>

<p>“Whosoever may question assertions that tend to shew
y’ mankinde evidences of a Divine thought interfusing th’
human minde, hath but to prove it by experiment. He
would not bee ready to cavil, or laugh to scorn this assertion,
which I may repeate anon, that Divine aide was
given me in my work. I have, at th’ least, accomplished a
great work in fewe yeares, work of such a difficult nature
that no one hand could accomplish, except other than
myselfe upheld or directed it.” And “anon,” he repeats,
“surely my hand and braine have but short rest. I firmly
believe it were not in the power of humane beings to do
anie more than I have done, yet I am but partlie satisfied.”</p>

<p>These excerpts, which have been given at some length,
disclose not only the exact nature and extent of the alleged
claims, but the style and manner in which they are
couched. There is nothing of the literary polish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
elegance in the cipher writing which we find in all of
Bacon’s acknowledged works, but taking into consideration
the difficulties of dropping the cipher into the books in
which it is said to appear, and the even greater difficulties
of interpreting it, it seems manifestly unfair to dismiss the
entire thing as an imposture on that account. Mr. Mallock’s
contention is that Mrs. Gallup’s theory is sufficiently
plausible to merit it an unprejudiced investigation. If
the cipher proves to be altogether false, the manner in
which it has been elaborated will, Mr. Mallock submits,
form a curious incident in literary history; while should
it prove true, it will be more curious still. Apart from the
cipher, Mr. Sinnett declares, there are floods of reasons
for disbelieving that Shakespeare could have written the
plays. Mr. Sinnett, and the other leaders of the Baconian
cult, do not appear to see that if their theory is to outlast
the present controversy, the cipher business must be
thrown overboard forthwith.</p>

<p>As Mr. William Archer has said with reference to
these ciphers, the point at issue is as plain as a pike-staff.
We are not concerned, while we deal with this phase of the
subject, in the verbal parallels between Shakespeare’s
writings and those of Bacon, nor with the vehemently
expressed conviction of students and scholars that Bacon
did not write <i>Shakespeare</i>. All we desire to know is
whether the ciphers which Mrs. Gallup and Dr. Owen
contend are contained in certain books (the <i>First Folio
Shakespeare</i> among others) really exist. Mr. Mallock says
that until an examination by experts in typography has
negatived this theory, he is inclined to believe it. His
position is unassailable. Nothing further can be argued
or asserted (with conviction) until a committee of experts
have made their report. If they declare that the cipher
has no foundation in fact, the students who have carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
perused Mrs. Gallup’s great work&mdash;great invention it will
then be&mdash;and Dr. Owen’s many volumes of badly-constructed,
ridiculous plays and poems, will give both Mrs.
Gallup and Dr. Owen credit for a veritable triumph of
misapplied energy and endurance&mdash;for having conceived a
masterpiece of diabolical inventiveness, for having revealed
a perfect genius for the perpetration of literary fraud.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not expect to learn that they will be
convicted of the possession of such an exceptional gift of
deception. Their labours smack of honesty; their
conclusions betray an ingenuous credulity that calls for
respect. It will, indeed, surprise most people who have
made a study of their works, if it is proved that the
cipher they claim to have discovered, and manipulated
with such marvellous results, is a myth. But assuming
that a properly-constituted committee did declare that the
cipher was to be found in all the books indicated, and
that the investigation corroborated the revelations made
by Mrs. Gallup and Dr. Owen, there would still remain
the question as to who concealed the statements in the
different volumes, and whether there is any truth in them.</p>

<p>I think, nay I claim, that in the event of the cipher being
verified, and the translations being confirmed, that (<i>a</i>) The
cipher could have been introduced by no other man than
Bacon; and that (<i>b</i>) The whole of the statements found
therein are false from beginning to end. In a searching
investigation into the cipher undertaken by a correspondent
of the <i>Times</i>, a single page of the cipher was tested, but the
test is not, as the <i>Times</i> claims for it, entirely convincing.
The method of investigation employed is excellent. A
greatly enlarged photograph is taken of a page from the
<i>Epistle Dedicatory</i> to the <i>Ruine of Time</i> in the 1591 edition
of Spenser’s <i>Complaints</i>, and the “A” and “B” letters
which Mrs. Gallup herself assigns to the parts respectively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
are cut out and arranged in parallel columns. When these
two sets of letters are seen side by side it would, indeed,
be difficult for the untrained eye to distinguish any marks
of dissimilarity between them. But as Mr. Mallock tells
us, “although even the naked eye can be soon trained to
perceive that in many cases the letters belong to different
founts, yet these differences are of so minute a kind that in
other cases they allude the eye without the aid of a magnifying
glass; and even with the aid of a magnifying glass,
the eye of the amateur, at all events, remains doubtful, and
unable to assign the letters to this alphabet or to that.”
The correspondent of the <i>Times</i> leads us to infer that he
has been unable to verify the existence of the cipher in the
page he has tested, and Mr. Lee has declared, without
hesitation, that the cipher does not exist in the Shakespeare
First Folio. On the other hand, Mr. Mallock had little
difficulty in distinguishing the different founts in the
facsimiles from the <i>Novum Organum</i> and Spenser’s <i>Complaints</i>.
He experimented with a large number of passages,
and comparing his interpretation with that of Mrs. Gallup,
he found that it coincided with hers, sometimes in four
cases out of seven, and not infrequently in five. “It
appears to me,” Mr. Mallock writes, “to be almost inconceivable
that multiplied coincidences such as these can be
the work of chance, or that they can originate otherwise
than in the fact that in these pages at all events&mdash;the
preface to the <i>Novum Organum</i>, printed in 1620, and in
the Dedication of Spenser’s <i>Complaints</i>, printed in 1591&mdash;a
bi-literal cipher exists, in both cases the work of Bacon;
and if such a cipher really exists here, the probabilities are
overwhelming that Mrs. Gallup is right, and that we shall
find it existing in the first folio of Shakespeare also.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Bacon</span>’s ciphers, which were, according to the evidence
adduced from the bi-literal, six in number, grew one
out of the other. Bacon evidently expected the bi-literal
to be discovered first, for in this cipher he explains the
word-cipher, in which his hidden, or “interiour” works
are concealed. Dr. Owen discovered this word-cipher
without the aid of the bi-literal, and by following its
directions he has deciphered over a thousand pages of blank
verse, comprising <i>Letters to the Decipherer</i>, <i>A Description of
Queen Elizabeth</i>, a poem entitled <i>The Spanish Armada</i>, <i>An
Account of Bacon’s Life in France</i>, and several plays. In
the <i>Epistle to the Decipherer</i>, Bacon says, “For thirty-three
years have we gone in travail, with these, the children of
our wit,” and proceeds to adjure the unknown to</p>

</div>

<p>The chief point to be noted about these cipher stories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
biographies and plays is that they are built up of quotations
from the works of all the authors whose writings
Bacon claims to be his own. Dr. Owen asks us, in all
seriousness, to believe that Bacon composed the plays of
Shakespeare, Marlowe, Peel, and Greene, and the poems
by Spenser, as they appear in the cipher translation, and
that he subsequently “decomposed and composed them
again” for circulation in his own day, under the names of
the various authors who acted as his masques. “When
deciphered and replaced in their original form,” Dr. Owen
asserts, “they <i>mean something</i> which they <i>do not</i> in the
plays.” Such a statement, as anyone can prove by turning
to these curious deciphered books, is both fallacious and
absurd.</p>

<p>Let us see what these passages which <i>mean nothing</i> in
the plays mean in the cipher stories. The pledge which
Hamlet imposes upon Horatio and Marcellus after the
interview with the ghost is a serviceable case in point.
Hamlet’s words are almost too familiar to need repeating:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“So help you mercy, that how strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or odd soe’er I bear myself&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To put an antic disposition on&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms encumber’d thus, or this head shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ‘Well, well, we know;’&mdash;or ‘We could, and if we would;’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ‘If we list to speak;’&mdash;or, ‘There be, an if they might:’&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or such ambiguous giving out, to note<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So grace and mercy at your most need help you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swear.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>No one can question the fitness and perfect appropriateness
of the foregoing passage in <i>Hamlet</i>, but it is
doubtful if anybody, other than Dr. Owen, will recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
their cogency when they are addressed by Bacon to his
unknown decipherer.</p>

<p>Bacon declares that Bottom’s recital of his dream,
which commences,</p>

changing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The words from one end to another, make it read aright.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Bacon heartens his timorous decipherer with the words,
“Be thou not, therefore, afraid of greatness”&mdash;the greatness
that he will attain as the reward of his decipherations.
“Some,” he assures the unknown, in the memorable
words, “have greatness thrust upon them,” and he further
reminds him that</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Nature and fortune joined to make you great,” Bacon
tells his decipherer, from the text of <i>King John</i>, and one
can almost imagine Dr. Owen blushing with conscious
pride, as he translated this borrowed gem. He implores
the modest unknown to free his (Bacon’s) name from the
disgraceful part he had in the death of the Earl of Essex,
and <span class="locked">cries&mdash;</span></p>

Bacon’s exhortation to the discover of his wrongs.</p>

<p>But one travels in this precious cipher from foolishness
to foolishness&mdash;from destruction to damnation, in quick,
long strides. In the <i>Spanish Armada</i>, Elizabeth receives

</div>

<p>Bacon, in his normal moods, employs the royal style of
“we” and “us” when referring to himself, but in moments
of agitation, when, for instance, slaves and lions promenade
the thoroughfares of Dover, he drops, instinctively, like a
Scotchman into his native manner. “Whilst walking
thus,” he continues:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It might be thought that the foregoing instances have
been carefully sought out and employed to italicise the
foolishness of Dr. Owen’s statement that the plays were
first composed in this form, and that in this form alone is
their true meaning and relevancy fully demonstrated.
Such, however, is far from being the fact. If the reader
will take the trouble to wade through the mass of
incoherent commonplace, illuminated as it is by passages
of Shakespeare’s brilliant wit and inspired poesy which
make up these five volumes, he will find scores upon scores
of such meaningless and inopportune mis-quotations.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE BUST OF SHAKESPEARE AT STRATFORD-ON-AVON.</div></div>

<p>Dr. Owen himself concedes that “some parts of the
deciphered material”&mdash;viz., those parts which have not
their origin in Shakespeare, Spenser, and the works of the
other masques&mdash;“are not equal in literary power, poetic
thought, nor artistic construction to the well-known efforts
of Shakespeare,” but he accounts for this inequality on the
ground that “the necessities for concealment were so great
as to make the difficulties of the cipher serious, and artistic
re-construction impossible.” If it be granted, for the sake of
argument, that the quotations from the plays, which appear
in these “interiour” works, were from the pen of Shakespeare,
and that the original parts are the product of Bacon,
then Spedding’s contention that there are not “five lines
together to be found in Bacon which could be mistaken for
Shakespeare, or five lines in Shakespeare which could be
mistaken for Bacon, by one who was familiar with their
several styles, and practised in such observations,” is
proved up to the hilt. Indeed, and without any such concession
being allowed, it is impossible to compare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
original lines with the pirated passages in these cipher
books, and accept the two as the work of the same hand.
Dr. Owen, who is evidently neither “familiar with the
several styles” of Shakespeare and Bacon, nor “practised
in such observations,” invites his readers “to set aside the
different names upon the title pages, and ask themselves
whether two or more men could have written so exactly
alike.” His conclusions are equally destitute of logic or
critical acumen: “Either Francis Bacon and William
Shakespeare were the same man, at least so far as the
writings are concerned; or else, for once in the history
of mankind, two men, absolutely dissimilar in birth, in
education, and in bringing up, had the same thoughts,
used the same words, piled up the same ideas, wrote upon
the same subjects, and thought, wrote, talked, and dreamed
absolutely alike.” It is true that Shakespeare, in cipher,
bears an amazing likeness to Shakespeare in the plays, but
if the Shakespeare in the cipher is to be compared with the
Bacon either here or in his recognised works, Dr. Owen’s
conclusions are palpably absurd.</p>

<p>Dr. Owen promises still further cipher revelations of the
same startling nature, which will explain how Bacon succeeded
in using his various masques during the lifetime of
the alleged authors. “In the decipherings which will
appear in their regular order,” he says, “I have found an
epitome of the lives of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Green (he
is probably referring to Greene), Burton, Peele and Spenser
... the circumstances under which they were employed,
and the sums of money paid to each for the use of his
name. Anthony Bacon, the foster-brother of Francis, was
the unknown owner of the Globe Theatre. Shakespeare,
while uneducated, possessed a shrewd wit, and some talent
as an actor. He received, as a bribe, a share in the proceeds
of the theatre, and was the reputed manager. Bacon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
with his Court education and aristocratic associations,
could not be known as the author of plays or the associate
of play actors, and put Shakespeare forward as the mask
which covered his greatest work.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Even</span> at the risk of wearying my readers, it is necessary
for the purposes of this book, to make a critical
inspection of one of the “interiour” plays which Dr. Owen
has deciphered from many of the principal works of the
Elizabethan-Jacobean era. As all these hidden plays are
derived from the same source&mdash;the writings of Shakespeare,
Spenser, Greene, Marlowe, Peele, and Burton&mdash;the choice
of a subject for consideration would appear to be immaterial.
<i>The Tragedy of Mary Queen of Scots</i>, a “remarkable
production,” according to Dr. Owen, and one that “has
been pronounced a masterpiece,” would seem to have the
first claim upon our attention. The selection of “<i>The
Tragical Historie of our late brother Robert, Earl of Essex</i>,
by the author of <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Richard III.</i>, <i>Othello</i>, &amp;c.,” has
been decided upon, however; because, in the first place,
it is a later production, and in the second, it is declared by
Dr. Owen to bear “the impress of greater skill, more
experience, and far more intense personal feeling.” In the
Publisher’s Note, we are informed that it is “one of the
marvels of literature,” and “a work of the most thrilling
interest and historical value.” The prologue, which takes
the form of a soliloquy, embodies “the deepest philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
concerning things natural and spiritual, temporal and
eternal.” It can, moreover, “only be measured from the
point of view of its author, Francis Bacon.” This
“wonderful prologue,” which comprises some 200 lines of
blank verse, is really a wonder of misapplied misappropriation.
It opens with the Seven Ages of Man, to which
Bacon adds an eighth, “which rounds out and finishes
the story, with the “exit” from human view of all that is
mortal:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">In love and sacred pity, through the gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the holy edifice of stone, where, all in white,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And then doth mount the pulpit stairs and doth begin:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘O Lord, have mercy on us wretched sinners!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people answering cry as with one voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘O Lord, have mercy on us wretched sinners!’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then through the narrow winding churchway paths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With weary task foredone, under the shade<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The “eighth” age, it will be observed, is not an age at all,
but a funeral. To this striking addition to one of Shakespeare’s
best known passages, Bacon tacks on the whole of
Hamlet’s soliloquy, “To be or not to be,” commencing with
“To sleep, perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;” helps
himself to a pinch of Hamlet’s lines, “Oh, that this too
solid flesh would melt,” acknowledges in the language of
the King that “Our offence is rank, it smells to Heaven!”
promises that</p>

</div>

<p class="in0">The entire mosaic is the most unintelligible, inept, and
exasperating mixture of pathos, bathos, and sheer drivel
that has ever been claimed as the work of a learned, sane
man.</p>

<p>The first act opens outside the Queen’s hunting lodge.
Elizabeth alludes to her hounds in the lines allotted by
Shakespeare to Theseus (<i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>),
and has an interview with the Earl of Essex, who comes to
bring news of the Irish rising; and Bacon, who remains
mute during the entire scene. In the second scene, Essex
and Mr. Secretary Cecil come to open rupture in the
presence of the Queen. Cecil cries, in Shylock’s words,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Thou call’st me a dog before thou hast a cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But since I am a dog, beware my fangs;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and Essex retorts, in the prayer of Richard II.,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Now put it, <i>heaven</i>, in his physician’s mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To help him to his grave immediately!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lining of his coffers shall make coats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the mouth of King Richard II., these words had
some meaning, for it was the King’s intention to seize the
possessions of old John of Gaunt after his demise, and
Gaunt was on his death-bed. But Cecil is in excellent
good health, and if he were likely to die not a shilling of
his personalty would have reverted to the crown. If this
was the original form in which Bacon composed the plays
of Shakespeare, he was undoubtedly mad.</p>

<p>The Queen then administers to Essex the historical box
on the ear, which so enrages the choleric nobleman that
he “essays to draw his sword,” and is summarily dismissed
by the Queen, who, immediately repenting upon the reflection,</p>

<span class="i0">Methought he bore him here as doth a lion,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p  class="in0">despatches Cecil to follow and bring him back. Essex
boxes Cecil’s ear, refuses to listen to his wife’s reproof,
and having sent for his brother, Francis Bacon (who greets
him with</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Brother, to fall from heaven unto hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be cubbed up upon a sudden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will kill you”&mdash;&mdash;)<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">dismisses the smug, but “rightful Prince of Wales,” and
<span class="locked">soliloquises&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... “But I’ll use means to make my brother King;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Yet as he, Francis, has neither claimed it,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">His highness ‘Francis First,’ shall repose him<br /></span>
<span class="i3">At the tower; fair, or not fair, I will<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Yes, he must die; he is much too noble<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To conserve a life in base appliances.”...<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Taken as poetry, or as logic, the effort is not a masterpiece;
it is, presumably, one of those portions in which “the
necessities for concealment” were so great as to make
“artistic construction impossible.” But it certainly
explains, in a way, the reason of the traitorous behaviour
of Bacon towards Essex in the hour of the latter’s
adversity. The poetry improves again in the next scene.
By misquoting the words of Junius Brutus respecting
Caius Marcus,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“All speak praise of him, and the bleared sights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are spectacled to see him pass along,” &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">(it is impossible to determine whether the inaccuracies in
quotation should be blamed upon Bacon or Dr. Owen), and
adding thereto the jealous Richard II.’s contemptuous
reference to Bolingbroke:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“A brace of draymen did God-speed him well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had the tribute of his supple knee,” &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>
<p class="in0">Bacon discloses Elizabeth’s mental attitude towards the
recalcitrant Earl. Directly Essex enters, however, the
Queen promises him that he will soon be known as Duke
of York, and she meets his objection,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">“My princely brother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Francis, your quondam son, tells me flatly<br /></span>

</div></div>

<span class="iq">“The proud jack! ’tis true, if it comes to that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is the Prince of Wales. But”....<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Now Bacon must have known, as well as Elizabeth,
that neither he, nor Essex, nor anybody else would be
Prince of Wales unless so created by the reigning
monarch. But Essex is so full of his Irish command
that he overlooks such trifles, and in the next scene he
sends a captain to the Queen for a thousand pounds, with
the admonition,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="in0">In the third act, the Queen does the sleep-walking scene
from <i>Macbeth</i>. Essex returns to England, uttering the
words used by Richard II. on his own safe arrival from
Ireland, to be upbraided by the Queen in the Duke of
York’s words to Bolingbroke:</p>

Marcus’ return to Rome, illustrate the reception that
London tendered to the disobedient Earl. Essex revolts,
and fortifies himself in his house in London. When
ordered by the Chief Justice of England to surrender,
Essex replies in the magnificent curse which Mark Antony
utters against Rome over the corpse of the murdered
Cæsar. The lack of enthusiasm which the citizens of
London display in the Essex rebellion is related to the
Earl in the report which Buckingham makes to the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>

employs the passage between Northampton and the King

the Chief Justice dismisses Essex to execution in the
words that Henry V. applied to Scroop, Cambridge, and

<p>But the marvel of inept plagiarism, of consummate
wrongheadedness, and ignorance in the bestowal of stolen
property, is seen in the last act of this marvellous play.
Herein, Essex is discovered in a dungeon in the tower. He
is a man 34 years of age, and it is somewhat of a surprise
to find him declaring, in the (revised) language of little
Prince Arthur (<i>King John</i>):</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">That <i>Cecil</i> practices more harm to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is afraid of me, and I of him.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But it is more than a surprise to learn that this hardy
man of war is to be compelled by Bacon (Shakespeare
aiding) to play young Arthur to the bitter end. After being
surfeited with Francis Bacon’s choicest philosophy, the

<h2 id="ch_17"><i>Bacon, the Poet.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> whole of the new matter that we find in the play
under notice is so dissimilar from that of Shakespeare in
style, language, and expression, that it might be the work of
any author, American or English, even&mdash;if we accept the
statement of Spedding&mdash;of Bacon himself. It is difficult to
form any correct estimate of Bacon’s talent as a poet,
because, apart from his own description of himself as a
“concealed poet,” and his versification of the Psalms, we
have nothing to guide us. Spedding doubtless had these
Psalms in his mind when he pronounced so emphatically
upon the absence of similarity between the writings of
Shakespeare and Bacon. There is little extant verse of the
period which is so un-Shakespearean as this product
of Bacon’s maturity, which was dedicated to the pious
and learned George Herbert, whose verses on Bacon were
printed in 1637. The publication is a proof that Bacon
thought well of his work&mdash;it is not on record that anybody
else has endorsed that opinion. Indeed, these seven
Psalms give us all that we have, or want, of Bacon’s
poetry. The following is an extract from the first psalm:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“He shall be like the fruitful tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Planted along a running spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, in due season, constantly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A goodly yield of fruit doth bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose leaves continue always green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And are no prey to winter’s pow’r;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall that man not once be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Surprised with an evil hour.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>His rendering of the 90th psalm is not all as bald and
discordant as the following:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Begin Thy work, O Lord, in this our age,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shew it unto Thy servants that now live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to our children raise it many a stage,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That all the world to Thee may glory give.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Our handy-work likewise, as fruitful tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Let it, O Lord, blessed, not blasted be.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The beautiful 14th and 15th verses of the 104th psalm are
thus rendered by our “concealed poet”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Causing the earth put forth the grass for beasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And garden herbs, served at the greatest feasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bread that is all viands firmament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives a firm and solid nourishment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wine, man’s spirits for to recreate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oil, his face for to exhilarate.”<br /></span>

  <div class="caption">SHAKESPEARE’S HOUSE.</div></div>

<p class="in0">There can be no two opinions as to the merits of these
metrical efforts, which Bacon thought good enough to print
and to dedicate to his friend George Herbert. Spedding
says of them, “In compositions upon which a man would
have thought it a culpable waste of time to bestow any
serious labour, it would be idle to seek either for indications
of his taste or for a measure of his powers.” And again,
“of these verses of Bacon’s, it has been usual to speak
not only as a failure, but as a ridiculous failure; a censure
in which I cannot concur. An unpractised versifier (fancy
styling the author of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> and <i>Adonis</i>,
an ‘unpractised versifier!’)&mdash;who will not take time and
trouble about the work, must, of course, leave many bad
verses; for poetic feeling and imagination, though they will
dislike a wrong word, will not of themselves suggest a
right one that will suit metre and rhyme; and it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
easy to quote from the few pages, not only many bad lines,
but many poor stanzas.” Spedding concludes with the
comment: “Considering how little he cared to publish
during the first sixty years of his life, and how many things
of weightier character and more careful workmanship he
had then by him in his cabinet, it was somewhat remarkable
that he should have given these Psalms to the world.”
Dr. Abbott, another friendly biographer and admirer of
Bacon’s “magnificent prose,” says:&mdash;“Some allowance
must be made (no doubt) for the fact that Bacon is translating,
and not writing original verse. Nevertheless a true
poet, even of a low order, could hardly betray so clearly
the cramping influence of rhyme and metre. There is far
less beauty of diction and phrase in these verse translations
than in any of the prose works that are couched in an
elevated style.... But I cannot help coming to the
conclusion that, although Bacon might have written
better verse on some subject of his own choosing, the
chances are that even his best would not have been very
good.”</p>

<p>But despite the appalling evidence of poetical incapacity
presented by this versification of the Psalms, a staunch
Baconian, by a train of argument which is only equalled
by that employed by Mr. Theobald, has proved, to his own
satisfaction, that Bacon was a poet, by locating the
position which the Plays occupy in the scheme of Bacon’s
works. This ingenious logician has discovered that the
two most extraordinary facts connected with Bacon’s
philosophy are (<i>a</i>) that the most eminent students have
been unable to understand his “method of interpretation,”
and (<i>b</i>) that the last three parts of the <i>Instauratio Magna</i>
are apparently wholly lost. Because Ellis and Spedding
both declare that “of his philosophy they can make
nothing,” and that “he failed in the very thing in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
he was most bent,” therefore he must be a poet. Because
the last three books of the <i>Instauratio</i> are “apparently
wholly lost”&mdash;which is the writer’s perversion of the
indubitable fact that they were never written&mdash;therefore
the comedies, histories, and tragedies of Shakespeare
actually form the fourth, fifth, and sixth books of “the
great work.” Firstly (to present this argument fairly),
Bacon declared his intention to insinuate his philosophy
into men’s minds by a method which would provoke no
controversy; secondly (this is not exactly proved, but just
stated as a fact), Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare;
and thirdly, the Plays are the treasure house of all art,
science, and wisdom. The natural and inevitable deduction
is that they must form the missing&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the unwritten&mdash;parts
of the <i>Instauratio Magna</i>.</p>

<p>I am afraid that we must decline to accept so ingenious
a piece of sophistry. Until it is proved that the Psalms
are a forgery, or that they have been erroneously attributed
to Bacon, we have a gauge of his poetical ability which is
fatal to his pretensions to the authorship of the Plays, of
Spenser, or of any one of the books which we are asked to
believe emanated from his stupendous intellect.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_18">“<i>Did Shakespeare Write Bacon?</i>”</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Mr</span>. Leslie Stephen, with amazing nerve and
a fine sense of humour, has carried the war of the
rival claims into the enemies’ country, and propounded the
theory, with no little plausibility, that so far from Bacon
being the author of the Plays, Shakespeare was the real
writer of Bacon’s philosophical works. Mr. Theobald
claims to prove that Bacon had ample leisure in which to
write all Shakespeare and his own books as well. Mr.
Stephen has come to the conclusion that his time was so
fully occupied with business, and political and financial
anxieties, that he never found the opportunity he was
always seeking to perfect his great philosophical reform.
Up to the year of the accession of James I., he had not
been able to prepare any statement of his philosophic
ideas. His desire, as we know from his letters, was to
stand well with the King; his scruples, as we also gather
from his letters, did not make him hesitate to employ
questionable practices when he had his own interests to
serve. If he had not time to write, he could get a book
written for him. He selected Shakespeare, who at this
period had a great reputation as the author of <i>Hamlet</i>,
for the purpose. Why Shakespeare, it may be asked?
Because, says Mr. Stephen, he knew Shakespeare through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Ben Jonson; he knew Southampton as a friend and patron
of Shakespeare, and he therefore employed Shakespeare
through Southampton&mdash;the present of £1,000, which it is
known was made to Shakespeare by his youthful patron,
being money paid by Bacon on account, for the writing of
the <i>Advancement of Learning</i>.</p>

<p>If the supposition that Shakespeare wrote this book for
Bacon be correct, argues Mr. Stephen, “he might naturally
try to insert some intimation of authorship to which he could
appeal in case of necessity.” Mr. Stephen sought for the
intimation in the <i>Advancement</i>, and he discovered it in the
first 81 letters. The opening words are, “There were
under the law, excellent King, both daily sacrifices and free
will offerings the one pro” (ceeding, &amp;c.) These letters (to
the end of pro) can be re-arranged to make the following:
“Crede Will Shakespeare, green innocent reader; he was
the author of excellent writing; F.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;N. fifth idol. lye.”
For the assistance of any one who cares to verify the
cipher, Mr. Stephen explains that in both cases (the
original and the decipheration) A occurs in 4 places, B in
1, C in 3, D in 3, E in 15, F in 4, G in 2, H in 4, I in 6, K
in 1, L in 6, N in 6, O in 4, P in 1, R in 7, S in 3, T in 5, U
in 1, W in 3, X in 1, and Y in 1.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE CHANCEL OF TRINITY CHURCH,
STRATFORD-ON-AVON.</div></div>

<p>Mr. Stephen assumes that Shakespeare explained this
saucy little anagram to Bacon when the work was
published, and that Bacon retaliated by “getting at” the
printers of the folio after Shakespeare’s death, and inserting
a cryptogram claiming the authorship for himself.
Bacon is imagined to have said to himself, “If Shakespeare
succeeds in claiming my philosophy, I will take his plays
in exchange.” “He had become,” says our theorist,
“demoralised to the point at which he could cheat his
conscience by such lamentable casuistry.” In 1608 Bacon
was Solicitor-General, and a rich man. He approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Shakespeare a second time with the object of having his
great philosophical work continued. Three years afterwards,
Shakespeare left the stage, and retired to pass the
last five years of his life at Stratford. Why did he retire?
“Because,” says Mr. Stephen, “Bacon had grown rich and
could make it worth his while to retire to a quiet place
where he would not be tempted to write plays, or drink at
the ‘Mermaid,’ or make indiscreet revelations.” If it
should be asked what he was doing, the answer is obvious.
He was writing the <i>Novum Organum</i>. Baconians and Mr.
Leslie Stephen are agreed that the <i>Novum Organum</i> is the
work of a poet, and that it was written by the author of
the Plays. But if it is conceded that Shakespeare wrote
<i>Novum Organum</i>, it still remains a mystery to Baconians
as to who wrote Shakespeare. After Shakespeare’s death,
Bacon, in <i>De Augmentis</i>, wrote that “the theatre might be
useful either for corruption or for discipline; but in modern
times there is plenty of corruption on the stage, and no
discipline.” Mr. Stephen deduces from this that in order
to aim a back-handed blow at Shakespeare, Bacon would
blaspheme the art of which he claimed to be master&mdash;that
he was, in fact, according to our other theorist, fouling the
fourth, fifth, and sixth books of his <i>Instauratio Magna</i>.</p>

<p>Neither of the theories we have just reviewed need be
taken seriously. We know that Bacon himself gave an
account of the scheme of the <i>Magna Instauratio</i> in a
section of the <i>Novum Organum</i>, called the <i>Distributio
Operis</i>. The fourth book was to have contained examples
of the “new method,” and of the results to which it led.
The fifth was to contain what Bacon had accomplished in
Natural Philosophy without the aid of his own method,
and the sixth was to set forth the New Philosophy&mdash;the
results of the application of the new method, and all the
Phenomena of the Universe. Mr. Leslie Ellis tells us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Bacon never hoped to complete the sixth part; he speaks
of it as a thing <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et supra vires et ultra spes nostras collocata</i>.
Mr. Leslie Stephen’s whimsical retort to the <i>Instauratio</i>
theory may be regarded as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_19"><i>The Case for Shakespeare.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> propounding their theory that Bacon was the author
of the plays attributed to Shakespeare, the Baconians
rely on two main arguments: the plausibility of the idea that
they should have emanated from the man whom Macaulay
declared to possess the “most exquisitely constructed
intellect that has ever been bestowed on any of the
children of men,” and the extraordinary unlikelihood that
a man of Shakespeare’s origin and antecedents should
have written them. More recently, the disclosure of the
bi-literal and the “word” ciphers, running through certain
editions of the plays, and in Bacon’s works, have placed a
new weapon in the hands of Shakespeare’s traducers.
Already some of the supporters of Bacon’s claims have
assumed a sceptical attitude towards the “cipher speculations”&mdash;partly,
I suspect, on account of their American
origin&mdash;and Mr. A.&nbsp;P. Sinnett, whilst claiming that if the
bi-literal cipher is substantiated, the Bacon case is demonstrated
up to the hilt, hedges himself behind the assertion
that the curious allegations now brought forward do not
affect, one way or the other, the general force of the literary
argument that supports the Baconian idea. But, unless
a gigantic fraud is being attempted&mdash;which we have no
reason to suppose is the case&mdash;Mrs. Elizabeth Wells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Gallup’s bi-literal cipher can easily be substantiated.
When this is accomplished, we only get to the point that
Bacon claims to have been the author of the plays put
forth by all his contemporaries, while the conviction still
remains, as it was expressed by Carlyle, that “Bacon
could no more have written <i>Hamlet</i> than he could have
made this planet.”</p>

<p>It is interesting in this connection to briefly sum up the
concensus of expert opinion that the leading scholars and
students of Elizabethan literature hold on the subject.
Mr. Sidney Lee, whose <i>Life of William Shakespeare</i> has
been called “the most useful, the most judicious, and the
most authoritative of all existing biographies of the poet,”
regards the theory as “fantastic.” The substance of Mr.
Lee’s conclusions is that “the abundance of the contemporary
evidence attesting Shakespeare’s responsibility for
the works published under his name, gives the Baconian
theory no rational right to a hearing; while such authentic
examples of Bacon’s effort to write verse as survive prove,
beyond all possibility of contradiction, that great as he was
as a prose writer and a philosopher, he was incapable
of penning any of the poetry assigned to Shakespeare.
Defective knowledge and illogical, or casuistical, argument
alone render any other conclusion possible.”</p>

and Character</i>, has on the Baconian theory four things to
say:&mdash;1. Bacon’s requital of the Earl’s bounty (the Earl of
Essex) was such a piece of ingratitude as I can hardly
conceive the author of <i>King Lear</i> to have been guilty of.
2. The author of Shakespeare’s plays, whatever he may
have been, certainly was not a scholar. He had certainly
something far better than learning, but he had not that.
3. Shakespeare never philosophises. Bacon never does
anything else. 4. Bacon’s mind, great as it was, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
have been cut out of Shakespeare’s without being missed.</p>

<p>But if, in the absence of anything bearing an even
remote resemblance to proof, we find ourselves compelled
to make a synopsis of expert opinion on the subject, we
shall find no man’s conclusions more deserving of respect
and acceptance than those of the late James Spedding.
Without intending to cast any reflection upon the critics
and others who have plunged with ebullient enthusiasm
into this controversy, it may not be out of place to point
out that Spedding is head and shoulders above all disputants
in knowledge, and second to none in critical ability. His
knowledge of Shakespeare was intimate and profound, and
he knew his Bacon more thoroughly than it has been the
lot of any other man of letters to be known by his fellow
man. He gave up his position in the Colonial Office, and
declined the position of Under-Secretary of State, with
£2,000 a year, in order to devote his whole time to the
study of the life and works of Lord Bacon&mdash;a task which
occupied him for nearly thirty years. Sir Henry Taylor, in
a letter to a friend in 1861, wrote as follows:&mdash;“I have
been reading Spedding’s <i>Life and Letters of Lord Bacon</i>
with profound interest and admiration&mdash;admiration not of
the perfect style and penetrating judgment only, but also
of the extraordinary labours bestowed upon the works by
a lazy man; the labour of some twenty years, I believe,
spent in rummaging among old records in all places they
were to be found, and collating different copies of manuscripts
written in the handwriting of the 16th century, and
noting the minutest variations of one from another&mdash;an
inexpressibly tedious kind of drudgery, and, what was,
perhaps, still worse, searching far and wide, waiting,
watching, peering, prying through long years for records
which no industry could recover. I doubt whether there
be any other example in literary history of so large an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
intellect as Spedding’s devoting itself, with so much self-sacrifice,
to the illustration of one which was larger still,
and doing so out of reverence, not so much for that largest
intellect, as for the truth concerning it.” Sir Henry Taylor,
in this passage, not only does justice to the diligence and
genius of the author, but recognises the spirit in which
the work was undertaken. Spedding spent thirty years in
quest of the truth concerning this remarkable man, and
having discovered it, he was prepared to maintain his
conclusions with all the power of his knowledge and
commanding intelligence. These qualities he exercised
with paralysing effect against Lord Macaulay’s <i>Essay on
Bacon</i>. It has been claimed by one champion of Shakespeare’s
cause that Macaulay’s “well-known depth of
research, comprehensive grasp of facts and details, and his
calm method of presenting honest conclusions, renders him
pre-eminent as a safe authority.” The exact opposite is, of
course, the case, but the possession of these very qualities are
revealed by Spedding in his <i>Evenings with a Reviewer</i>, to the
utter spoliation of a great number of Macaulay’s cherished
calculations and conclusions. “No more conscientious, no
more sagacious critic,” according to G.&nbsp;S. Venables, “has
employed in a not unworthy task the labour of his life,”
and the same writer has also declared that “the historical
and biographical conclusions which he (Spedding) established
depend on an exhaustive accumulation of evidence
arranged and interpreted by the clearest of intellects, with
an honesty which is rarely known in controversial discussion.”
Spedding is, in brief, universally acknowledged
to be not only the greatest authority on Bacon, but also of
the times in which he lived. His acquaintance with
Elizabethan literature, its history, and its manuscripts was
unique&mdash;he was, it may be said without fear of contradiction,
a master of his period. “His knowledge of Shakespeare,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
says Venables, in the prefatory notice to <i>Evenings with a
Reviewer</i>, “was extensive and profound, and his laborious
and subtle criticism derived additional value from his love
of the stage.” The opinion of such an authority on such
a subject as the authorship of plays attributed to Shakespeare
is, in default of proof to the contrary, of the highest
possible value&mdash;to a close student of Spedding it must
appear incontrovertible.</p>

<p>Spedding’s article on the question, which is included in
the volume of <i>Reviews and Discussions</i> (Kegan Paul, Trench
&amp; Co., 1879) was written in reply to Professor Nathaniel
Holmes’ treatise on <i>The Authorship of Shakespeare</i>. In his
opening sentence, he says, “I have read your book ...
faithfully to the end, and if my report of the result is
to be equally faithful, I must declare myself not only
unconvinced, but undisturbed.”</p>

<p>He is instant and decisive with his reasons. “To ask
me,” he continues, “to believe that a man who was famous
for a variety of other accomplishments, whose life was
divided between public business, the practice of a laborious
profession, and private study of the art of investigating the
material laws of nature&mdash;a man of large acquaintance, of
note from early manhood, and one of the busiest men of
his time, but who was never suspected of wasting his time
in writing poetry, and is not known to have written a
single blank verse in all his life&mdash;that this man was the
author of fourteen comedies, ten historical plays, and eleven
tragedies, exhibiting the greatest, and the greatest variety,
of excellence that has been attained in that kind of composition,
is like asking me to believe that Lord Brougham
was the author, not only of Dickens’s novels, but of
Thackeray’s also, and of Tennyson’s poems besides.”</p>

<p>Spedding, himself a genius, finds no difficulty in appreciating
the quality of genius in Shakespeare. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
scholarship, or environment, or training that enabled
William Shakespeare to become the author of the most
wonderful series of dramas in the world. Of Shakespeare’s
gifts, he frankly states the wonder is that any man should
have possessed them, not that the man to whose lot they
fell was the son of a poor man called John Shakespeare,
and that he was christened William. If Shakespeare was
not trained as a scholar, or a man of science, neither do
the works attributed to him show traces of trained
scholarship or scientific education. Given the faculties
(which nature bestows as fully on the poor as on the rich)
you will find that the required knowledge, art and dexterity
which the Shakespearean plays imply, were easily attainable
by a man who was labouring in his vocation, and had
nothing else to do.”</p>

  <div class="caption">ANN HATHAWAY’S COTTAGE AT SHOTTERY.</div></div>

<p>What Spedding failed to grasp was the difficulty which
the Baconians find in believing that Shakespeare was as
likely to be the author of the plays as any other man of his
generation. In endeavouring to solve the extraordinary
difficulty of the old theory of the authorship of the plays
by substituting a new one, they have only made confusion
worse confounded. “That which is extraordinary in the
case,” Spedding maintains, “is that any man should
possess such a combination of faculties as must have met
in the author of these plays. But that is a difficulty which
cannot be avoided. There must have been <i>somebody</i> in
whom the requisite combination of faculties did meet, for
there the plays are; and by supposing that this somebody
was a man who, at the same time possessed a combination
of other faculties, themselves sufficient to make him an
extraordinary man too, you do not diminish the wonder,
but increase it.... That a human being possessed of the
faculties necessary to make a Shakespeare should exist, is
extraordinary. That a human being possessed of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
faculties necessary to make a Bacon should exist, is extraordinary.
That two such human beings should have been
living in London at the same time was more extraordinary
still. But that one man should have existed possessing
the faculties and opportunities necessary to make both,
would have been the most extraordinary thing of all.”</p>

<p>It may be contended, and with justice, that in the
foregoing we have arguments that did not require the
special knowledge and experience of a Spedding to prefer.
It may not be, it probably is not, regarded by Baconians as
serious argument, and, as Mr. R.&nbsp;M. Theobald would say, it
would be simply a waste of time and words to discuss it.
Certain is it that none of the pro-Bacon writers realise the
necessity of answering, and, if possible, contravening
these simple arguments. It is difficult to find any satisfactory
reason for their reticence. But whether it is that
they question the value of the views of the greatest student
of Bacon on this subject, or are ignorant of his essay, or&mdash;what
is more likely&mdash;are unable to combat so plausible a
view coming from so eminent an authority, the fact remains
that Spedding’s opinion is consistently disregarded.</p>

<p>It is not, however, that part of his argument which we
have quoted, but the part which follows which carries
conviction to those who are familiar with the work both of
Bacon and of Spedding. The resemblances in thought
and language, which are to be found in Shakespeare and
Bacon, are accepted by Spedding as inevitable between
writers nourished upon a common literature, employing a
common language, and influenced by a common atmosphere
of knowledge and opinion. “But to me,” he declares, “I
confess, the resemblances between Shakespeare and Bacon
are not so striking as their differences. Strange as it seems
that two such minds, both so vocal, should have existed
within each other’s hearing without mutually affecting each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
other, I find so few traces of any influence exercised by
Shakespeare upon Bacon, that I have great doubt whether
Bacon knew any more about him than Gladstone (probably)
knew about Tom Taylor (in his dramatic capacity).
Shakespeare may have derived a good deal from Bacon.
He had, no doubt, read the <i>Advancement of Learning</i> and
the first edition of the <i>Essays</i>, and most likely had frequently
heard him speak in the Courts and in the Star Chamber.
But among all the parallelisms which you have collected
with such industry to illustrate the identity of the writer,
I have not observed one in which I should not have
inferred, from the difference of style, a difference of hand.
Great writers, being contemporary, have many features in
common; but if they are really great writers, they write
naturally, and nature is always individual. I doubt whether
there are five lines together to be found in Bacon which
could be mistaken for Shakespeare, or five lines in Shakespeare
which could be mistaken for Bacon, by one who was
familiar with their several styles, and practised in such
observations. I was myself well read in Shakespeare before
I began with Bacon, and I have been forced to cultivate
what skill I have in distinguishing Bacon’s style to a high
degree; because in sifting the genuine from the spurious,
I had commonly nothing but the style to guide me. And
to me, if it were proved that any one of the plays attributed
to Shakespeare was really written by Bacon, not
the least extraordinary thing about it would be the power
which it would show in him of laying aside his individual
peculiarities and assuming those of a different man.”</p>

<p>There we have Spedding’s reasons for rejecting the
Baconian theory&mdash;let us summarise his conclusions in his
own words: “If you had fixed upon anybody else rather
than Bacon as the true author,” he says&mdash;“anybody of
whom I knew nothing&mdash;I should have been scarcely less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
incredulous, because I deny that a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prima facie</i> case is made
out for questioning Shakespeare’s title. But if there were
any reason for supposing that somebody else was the real
author, I think I am in a condition to say that, whoever
it was, it was not Bacon. The difficulties which such a
supposition would involve would be almost innumerable,
and altogether insurmountable. But,” he adds, “if what I
have said does not excuse me from saying more, what
I might say more would be equally ineffectual.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_20"><i>Were Shakespeare and Bacon Acquainted?</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> we are to believe in the existence of the cipher,
it follows as a matter of course that Bacon and
Shakespeare were acquainted. Nothing is more probable.
Bacon was at Court during the whole time that
Shakespeare’s plays were presented there. Bacon must
at one period have been acquainted with Shakespeare’s
patron, Lord Southampton, who was the bosom friend of
Bacon’s patron, the Earl of Essex. Bacon was certainly in
touch with Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s friend and co-worker.
It is scarcely conceivable that the two most
prominent figures in the literary world of the day should
have been unknown to one another, although there is
no authentic evidence to show that they were. In
<i>Shakespeare’s True Life</i> (1890), Major James Walter
publishes an illustration of Bacon’s house at St. Margaret’s,
Richmond, “where Shakespeare was a frequent visitor.”
“Twickenham,” says the writer, “is a main connecting
link with what is known of Shakespeare’s visits to the
neighbourhood; doubly interesting as clearly indicating
his intimacy with Bacon, then living at his house, only a
short distance on the other side of St. Margaret’s, in
Twickenham Park.” Again, “It was just shortly before
this plague fright, Shakespeare and Bacon had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
jointly engaged in getting up one or more of his plays in
Gray’s Inn, and it comes with the saying they should be
frequently together in the eminently charming retreat just
acquired by Bacon at the munificent hand of Elizabeth’s
Favourite (the Earl of Essex).” “Catholic tradition,”
the same authority assures us, “asserts that Bacon
wrote the first portion of his great essays under the
cedars of Twickenham Park; others go further, and say
our information is that Shakespeare and Bacon had a
special fondness for the two old cedars, and spent much
time on occasions of Shakespeare’s visiting and resting
with his friend at Twickenham, in reading and converse
under the shade of these widespreading venerable trees.”
In another part of the same book we read: “Some
families, whose past histories should afford information
bearing on Shakespeare’s life, assert that he met Spenser
and Sir Walter Raleigh on more than one occasion at
Richmond, and that Bacon was in the habit of receiving
them together at his St. Margaret’s home.”</p>

<p>Interesting as are these details, they are, it will be
observed, quite unsupported. What the Major says is,
unfortunately, “not evidence.” If Major Walter had given
us chapter and verse for all this information, we might have
verified his evidence for ourselves, but “Catholic tradition”
and the unnamed “families with past histories,”
and the “others” are too vague to pin one’s faith to.
We may, however, assume that Shakespeare was not
unknown to Bacon, that they met when Shakespeare was
appearing at Gray’s Inn; and it is quite possible, if not
probable, that Shakespeare consulted Bacon on the legal
references and similes that we find in the Plays.</p>

<p>Bacon, although disloyal, and capable of shameless
ingratitude towards his benefactors, had the love of his
secretary Rawley, and the warm esteem of such men as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Ben Jonson, Boëner, and Toby Matthew. Abbott, who is
fully awake to his many faults, notes this curious inconsistency
in his nature, and explains it in the conclusion
that “whenever he found men naturally and willingly
depending on him, and co-operating with him ... his
natural and general benevolence found full play.” If we
accept this explanation, and it would appear to be the
correct solution of his enigmatic character, we can readily
understand that Bacon, in a patronising, but good-hearted
way, would extend no little favour to a man of Shakespeare’s
position and reputation. Shakespeare would be
familiar with Bacon’s works, he may even have had the
run of Bacon’s library in Gray’s Inn&mdash;an assumption of
their intimacy, which, if supported by documentary
evidence, would establish the theory that the poet used
the philosopher as his model for Polonius. Bacon, the
great philosopher, and the influential politician, would
certainly have “the tribute of the supple knee” of all
aspirants to literary fame. Authors would be proud to
attract his notice, publishers would be flattered to allow
him to glance through the proofs of any books that they
were issuing. It is quite natural to suppose that if
Shakespeare was known to Bacon, Heming and Condell
would have been aware of the fact, and an offer to render
them some assistance in publishing the First Folio would
have been accepted with alacrity. Such an offer may have
been made through Rawley, his faithful secretary; it might
have come direct from Bacon to the publishers. How he
obtained command of the proofs it is impossible to
conjecture with any confidence, but if it is proved that
the cipher exists in the Folio, and the other works
mentioned&mdash;and I am satisfied to believe that it does, until
a properly constituted committee reports that it is non-existent&mdash;it
will be evident that somebody must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
overcome the difficulties that the task presented. The law
at that time recognised no natural right in an author to the
creation of his brain, and the full owner of a MS. copy of
any literary composition was entitled to reproduce it, or to
treat it as he pleased, without reference to the author’s
wishes. Thomas Thorpe, and the other pirates of the
period, were always on the look-out for written copies of
plays and poems for publication in this manner. All
Shakespeare’s plays that appeared in print were issued
without his authority, and, in several instances, against his
expressed wish. How did Thorpe and his tribe obtain
possession of the manuscripts of <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Henry V.</i>,
<i>Pericles</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and the rest of the
sixteen plays which were in print at the date of the
author’s death? If we knew for certain that Shakespeare
and Bacon were on terms of intimacy, it would be a
justifiable conjecture to suppose that the latter might have
had a hand in the business, but if the existence of the
cipher in these pirated quartos is verified, we may be quite
sure that Bacon was the publishers’ accessory in securing
the MSS. for publication.</p>

<p>It is, however, more difficult to satisfactorily explain
the claim of Bacon to the authorship of the <i>Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>. The first edition, in quarto form, was published
in 1621; the cipher appears in the folio that was issued in
1628. In the preface to this edition, the author announces
that he will make no more changes in his work: “I will
not hereafter add, alter, or retract; I have done.” What
do we gather from that, Mrs. Gallup may ask?&mdash;surely
that Bacon felt his strength failing when he wrote those
words; he certainly did not live to see the book through
the press. But the fact remains that four more editions were
published within Burton’s lifetime, each with successive
alterations and additions. The final form of the book was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the sixth edition (1651&ndash;52), printed from an annotated copy
given just before Burton’s death to the publisher, Henry
Cripps, who gained, Anthony à Wood tells us, great profits
out of the book. This is one of the points upon which we
shall hope to hear from Mrs. Gallup.</p>

<p>In this 1628 folio of the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, Mrs.
Gallup has deciphered some ninety pages of a partial
translation of Homer’s <i>Iliad</i>. But on comparing this
translation with that of Alexander Pope, written about a
century later, it becomes clear that it is not taken from the
original Greek of Homer, but is, in fact, a prose rendering
of Pope’s version. But Mrs. Gallup in a letter to the
<i>Times</i>, which appears as these pages are going through the
press, declares that an examination of six different English
translations of the <i>Iliad</i>, and one Latin, shows her such
substantial accord that either of them could be called
with equal justice a paraphrase of Pope, or that Pope had
copied from the others.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="ch_21"><i>In Conclusion.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Three</span> of the main arguments which Baconians urge
against the claims of Shakespeare to the authorship
of the Plays are, firstly, that Shakespeare left no books;
secondly, that only five of his signatures have come down to
us; and, thirdly, that he makes no reference to his plays in
his Will. When we come to investigate these objections, it
may be said, without hesitation, that they do not amount
to a row of pins. There isn’t a rag of evidence, to
employ Mr. Sinnett’s phrase, to show that he left no books,
it is quite certain that he left as much manuscript as Peele
or Marlowe or any of the dramatists of his period, and it
would have been something more than extraordinary if he
had made any reference to copyrights which he did not
possess. The professional playwrights of the period sold
their plays outright to one or other of the acting companies,
and they retained no legal interest in them after
the manuscript had passed into the hands of the theatrical
manager. When Shakespeare had disposed of his dramas,
he washed his hands of them, so to speak, and not a
single play of the sixteen that were published during his
lifetime was issued under his supervision. They belonged
to the theatre for which they were written. Shakespeare
was only conforming to the general custom in this matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
in betraying no interest in work which did not belong to
him. He was consistently and characteristically indifferent
as to what became of his plays, and in this he forms a
striking contrast to Bacon, who had a mania for preserving
and publishing every particle of his writings. In Shakespeare,
this neglect, if surprising, is at least consistent; in
Bacon it is too antagonistic to what is known of his
idiosyncracies to be entertained for a single moment.
Bacon must have realised that his versification of the
Psalms was of less merit than the poetry in the plays.
Yet he carefully superintended the publication of the
Psalms, in the same year in which they were written,
and kept no copies of such plays as <i>The Tempest</i>, <i>The Two
Gentlemen</i>, <i>Measure for Measure</i>, <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>As You
Like It</i>, <i>All’s Well</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, <i>Winter’s Tale</i>, <i>Henry
VI.</i>, <i>Henry VIII.</i>, <i>Coriolanus</i>, <i>Timon</i>, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>,
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, and <i>Cymbeline</i>. These works of
“supreme literary interest” were rescued from the dust-bin
of the theatres, by the energy and affection of two of
Shakespeare’s brother actors, what time Bacon was translating
his philosophical works into Latin, and publishing
the Psalms.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages, Bacon’s character, and the
incidents in his life have, it may be objected, been dealt
with in a harsh and unsympathetic manner. Yet the facts
set down are matters of history, and I claim for the
comments, and the conclusions derived therefrom, that
they are neither misleading nor exaggerated. It has been
my endeavour to show that, while all that we know of
Bacon’s private life and his public career&mdash;the evidence of
his deeds, his sentiments, his prose, and his verse&mdash;prove
him to have been a man incapable of conceiving the poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of the Plays, there is nothing in the life of Shakespeare,
when freed of the miserable misrepresentations and baseless
accusations introduced by his traducers, which makes
it difficult for us to regard him as the rightful author. One
thing we must recognise in the writer of the greatest
poetry of all times&mdash;his genius. We cannot argue that
Shakespeare had genius&mdash;and, therefore, he wrote the plays&mdash;but
we may transpose the argument and declare that
Shakespeare wrote the plays, and therefore he had genius.
But, cries the Baconian, Bacon also possessed genius. The
fact is incontrovertible. His genius inspired him to draw
up the scheme of his <i>Magna Instauratio</i>, to write his <i>Essays</i>,
to invent a new philosophy, and a most ingenious cipher,
but it did not prevent him from composing some miserably
poor verses or enable him to discern the singular absence
of merit in his metrical effusions. There is not a single
“literary” argument of the hundreds put forward in
support of Bacon’s claims to the authorship of the Plays
which has validity, or even plausibility, to recommend it.
There is not a single argument of the hundreds that have
been advanced to deprive Shakespeare of his mantle which
can stand the test of investigation. Carlyle declared Bacon
to be as incapable of writing <i>Hamlet</i> as of making this
planet. Spedding, who devoted thirty years of his life to
the study of Bacon, emphatically asserts that, “if there
were any reason for supposing that somebody else was the
real author (of Shakespeare), I think I am in a condition
to say that, whoever it was, it was not Bacon.” We know
that Shakespeare put the plays on the stage, and acted in
them, and that his intimate friends, his fellow actors, and
the public, believed him to be the writer. We know, too,
that Bacon had a distaste, if not a contempt, for the stage;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
that his lifelong complaint was his inability to secure time
for his philosophic studies. To sum up in a sentence, it
may be said that there is no reason to suppose that Bacon
was the author of the Plays, while there is every reason
to believe that he was not; and with respect to Shakespeare,
there is no reason to believe he was not what he
claimed to be, and there is tradition, the testimony of all
who had the best means of knowing, to prove that he was.</p>

<p>Until very recent times, one of the most tangible
arguments of the Shakespeareans was that Bacon had not
claimed the authorship of the Plays. That argument, if it
has not now been thrown down, is, at least, suspended.
The existence of the bi-literal cipher which Mrs. Gallup
preaches, though vigorously attacked, has not yet been
exploded. But if the cipher which contains these claims
is verified, in the face of all circumstantial evidence that
prove the claims to be baseless and preposterous, we are
practically convicting Bacon of one of the greatest and
most impudent literary frauds that was ever perpetrated.
Yet that is what I am prepared to find is the case. Nor
am I without warrant for holding this opinion. When the
existence of the bi-literal, and the word-cipher has been
acknowledged, we shall find that there are four other forms
of cipher, the “Capital Letter; Time, or as more oft called,
Clocke; Symboll; and Anagrammaticke ... which wee
have us’d in a few of owr bookes.” These ciphers are now
being applied to decipher other messages which Bacon
sent down the ages by this secret medium. Of the nature
of these claims, I am, at the moment, unable to speak,
